Jacob); Schikher, Ronald L; Sanderson, Janet A; Djerassi, Alexander M; Heffern, John A; Degnan, Kelly C Subject: RE: Itenghazi and NATO Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations. Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid friendly fire incidents, of course.

By Sarah Chayes November 15, 2012 The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political. The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies, creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of non-military approaches. When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then, Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man could offer him. Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy approach. With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice.

NO FOIA WAIVER. the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control. But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to employ which tactics to defeat the enemy? What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and legal leverage. Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind. The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at the helm of the CIA. Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart, adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents. But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack. Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled. And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench. Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand, restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi September 11, 2012 I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack. This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and pledged his government's full cooperation. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind. In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide. Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya September 12, 2012 It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues. A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi. I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger. Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal, and most recently The Hague. All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future. America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them. Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya September 12, 2012 Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost. All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and generous nation. In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn. Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own. In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to Benghazi. The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be. But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group — not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible. The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies, consulates, and citizens. There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya September 13, 2012 The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and Glen. Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill, honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few months ago. We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and unstinting valor. We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue September 13, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today. We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into violence. I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course, millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith. To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue. Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better understuiding across countries and cultures.

Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no matter how distasteful they may be. There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line. I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better future. In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat earlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today. On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on this issue. With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work toward resolution. With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially among young people. That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries. Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the benefits for Moroccans. Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement. There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended. Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us. There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr. Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue. In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together. So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for the world. So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your distinguished delegation. Thank you. (Applause.) Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr September 13, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it: Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

This comes during sad and difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen. The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our ambassador. Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words? AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted] SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya. Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people. Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere. Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity. But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack. Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same goes for all faiths, including Islam.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence. And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable. So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment, answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength. In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue. But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us moving forward in a positive direction. So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek, but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are doing to help shape that better future. Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young leaders, each with a powerful story to tell. The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities. They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do. People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but, frankly, for us who are older as well. Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities. And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya September 14, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and deepest gratitude. Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family, friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners who shared his passion. Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

He too died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and colleagues. I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them build a better country. People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris. He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense of fun and that California cool. In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said ""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,"" The President of the Palestinian Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — ""an act of ugly terror."" Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments. This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world. There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

They help make the United States the greatest force for peace, progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of what makes America great and good. So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were doing for our country. The President of the United States. Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their Meeting September 18, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the highest levels of each of our governments. Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S. response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi. The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact. Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we focused on a top priority for us both a security.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States. As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree. We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time to come. Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our security relationship with Mexico is to the United States. The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us. Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security. So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much. MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News. QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to the Libyans? SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security- needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four, colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished. It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region. In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly, we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual respect. This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American facilities. And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against violence, whoever incites it or conducts it And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

And I want to underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that they experienced can be realized. And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound. And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or imminent. But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with. Thank you. Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana Natalegawa After Their Meeting September 20, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission. This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership, and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce. And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very impressed. We covered a great deal today. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it. But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen. Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region. On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects. And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600 million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open. The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic integration across the Asia Pacific. Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children. And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

The Foreign Minister's personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles, which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force. Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges, from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on women's empowerment. We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation. So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between us and between our countries. MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera English. QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi. You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of Foreign Service Officers around the world? And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt that he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld, along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government. Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events, and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week. And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering. I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies, these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore security and civil order. And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands. We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of Congress. As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any basis for that. QUESTION: Thank you. MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please. QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's — obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. — Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible) program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others. In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia. FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond. Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case. Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is actually coordinated as well. But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past, Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among states. So that's our point of departure. At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well. SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you all very much. FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Thank you. Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting September 21, 2012 Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral relationship as well as regional and global issues. I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi. And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible. But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important contributions to the work of our missions. The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be, but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them. Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations. And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow the movement of goods to Afghanistan. We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.- Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group. Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium sized companies get access to capital. Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent threats to their neighbors and the international community. So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives. Thank you very much. Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting September 21, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the violent assaults of last Friday. We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely with host governments in this effort. As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions. They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting violence and holding violent actors accountable. We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law. The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time. They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-. , ,encia.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them. So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates. So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the future of Tunisia.

"Cohen Post <body> The Washington Post December 4, 2012 Tuesday Regional Edition SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25 HEADLINE: It's not about Rice BYLINE: Richard Cohen BODY: In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his day. Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more at work. At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate. But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she. Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed. I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is chairman. But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739841 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

For the most part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy. So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else (with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme. Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become, but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya. This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for intervention, not just say it's too hard to do. The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American power, not merely American politics.

"Statement <body> Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues. A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi. I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger. Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future. America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them. 1#tit U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739906 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

"Ap/Nk <body> Report: North Korea willing to hold talks with US AP By KWANG-TAE KIM Associated Press Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. ""We are not against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,"" Japan's Kyodo news agency quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia, saying ""the six-party talks are gone forever."" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North Korea and the U.S. were slim. ""Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective approach"" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks ""cheated"" North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. ""North Korea will be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to ""small children"" demanding attention. At a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North ""has no friends left."" North Korea's Foreign Ministry described her Thursday as ""a funny lady"" who sometimes ""looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping."" 298",Later

Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike United States Institute of Peace: Background Proposals for the creation of a government ""peace"" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a ""Peace Office"" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board of Directors took place in 1986. The USIP Act established ""an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence."" USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country- specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include: ® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and educating the public through events, films, and other outreach. O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries. ® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria, Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti. ® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M.

"How Anthony Weiner Helped The Public Option Return From The Brink -- New York Magazine <body> Magazine The Power Grid Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House, returned from the brink. •Published Oct 11, 2009 On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the legislation instead. ""It's just too weak,"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the bill. His political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead,"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious, wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out there speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town- hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist; he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this has become my issue,"" Weiner says. ""If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows that he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a ""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and 1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that ""up to now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple of hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,"" he tells me. Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy",Discard

There is much disillusionment over the aftermath of the elections and the ongoing violence. It would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move Afghanistan forward. Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned. I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment. Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if he tapped women and so many are highly qualified. Thanks.",Later

They include, and feel free to hum along: open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of women, fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United States Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation, and lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox.

"Murtha... <body> Murtha back in the hospital By: David Rogers February 2,2010 10:43 AM EST Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha was back in the hospital Tuesday after undergoing gall bladder surgery last week. The Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington said that the 77-year-old Democrat was a patient in its intensive care unit but referred all questions about his condition to his family. Murtha's congressional office confirmed that he underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gallbladder at Bethesda Naval Hospital last week. But the congressman's spokesman refused comment on the seriousness of his condition or any complication that required hospitalization. A powerhouse in the House Appropriations Committee and close friend of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif.), Murtha was hospitalized for a period in December as well when he suffered an infection in his gall bladder. The doctors then decided that it should be removed once the infection had been tempered, and that set up the surgery last week at Bethesda. In the interim, Murtha has been back in the Capitol, and in his style, came back from the hospital— with IV bandages still on him— to oversee passage of his defense appropriations bill.",Discard

"Pinera-Insulza <body> See the report below: Pinera has announced his support. I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close friend, According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had no choice. That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously and don't carry the ALBA countries' water. Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him. Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on Pinera's support.",Delegate

"Mubarak Points <body> The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo. While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel has taken action on the ""five steps"" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3 with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would seek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy Envoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference (he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize that it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.",Later

She was instrumental in bringing FINCA to Kyrgyzstan and when you made your trip there you saw what a difference it was making to lift up women and their families. She also was her country's head of delegation to Beijing. She was foreign minister at the time and made a strong statement about gender equality and the transformative power of microcredit. I think she had an overseas post when you visited Kyrgyz so I don't think you met her.

"Sign Off <body> U ok with statement? Statement by the Secretary The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world, but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland. The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed. The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss. My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",Delegate

"Update On Interagency Sharing Of Foreign Audience Research <body> Madam Secretary, Jake asked me to send you a brief update on the effort to create an internal USG website for housing interagency information about the attitudes, concerns, and media habits of foreign audiences (following up on the memo INR sent to you on this subject in February). INR is working with the interagency to create six initial country pages (Indonesia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Yemen) on this website. In addition to background information about each country and its relationship with the United States, each page will focus on providing up to date information on how local audiences view the United States and an analysis of the mediums through which local audiences get their news. Pages will also include a list effective messaging themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country. In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking guidance as to which additional countries should be covered. The hope is that each page will evolve over time based on user feedback. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike Michael H. Fuchs U.S. De artment of State",Discard

There is no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation. Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely. I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who supported this historic effort. Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq. ###",Now

"Statement For Sign Off <body> Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example. From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.",Later

" <body> BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death eight school children last month. ""More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place,"" a commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers.

"H: Fyi, Iran Document Gary Sick Sent Me. Sid <body> sbwhoeop Wednesday, March 24, 2010 11:11 PM h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid From Gary Sick Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership. Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say. ""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the world ever more energetically..."" [real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.] ""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally towards the United States..."" [Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.] ""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did this happen? Of course not..."" [The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal, and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a straight face when they behave this way!] ""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's] opposition towards the Iranian nation..."" [Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!] ""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and respected..."" [All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.] ""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them..."" [We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the good old days...]",Later

Media highlighted reports that the U.S. and Pakistan sought ""wide-ranging, long term and substantive partnership,"" and ""established a policy steering group for further talks on strategic issues."" The signing of a letter of intent between the U.S. and Pakistan to help reconstruction of priority roads in Malakand division also received prominent display. Secretary of Defense Gates' meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, and his comments that the ""U.S. wants to increase the military funding of Pakistan"" received coverage. Pak Army Chief General Kayani's remarks that the ""military is willing to forgo its requests for hardware to ensure that Pakistan's energy and economic needs are met"" were also reported. Reports that GOP and the opposition are not on same page regarding talks with the U.S. received front-page display. The civilian nuclear deal issue made news as ""The News,"" reported that the ""FO seeks to hide unease over nuclear snub"" and ""The Nation,"" reported on front-page that ""U.S. affirms durable partnership but no civilian N-deal."" However Foreign Office spokesman's remarks, that the ""government is optimistic about a positive outcome"" was also reported. Terming the U.S. commitment of $125 million for the power sector, as ""crucial,"" ""The News,"" noted in its editorial that ""it needs to be translated into action urgently.""

It remains to be seen what Washington wants from Islamabad.""

"Cathy Ashton <body> As I mentioned last week, I was on a panel at the Brussels forum with Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call her Cathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, and Senator Voinovich. Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk (the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed, Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state- building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here. I hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY. Bob Hormats and I will send a note on other aspects of Brussels forum, where US was well represented. AM",Delegate
"Ajad Speech <body> Here's a basic summary: It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that US nonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves and that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us ""the most hated"" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 ""proposals"", most of which were previewed in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC. The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.",Later

MEDIA NOTE Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan. Begin Text: National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the political process. We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation, harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri participation. Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and liabilities. We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.",Now

The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani society.

"Fyi <body> SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.",Later

The Central Election Commission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within ten days; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko, who has been silent publicly, plans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts, but they will not change the result. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite street protests. Our recommendation is EU Ambassadors in Kiev have recommended the same approach to Brussels, but want to revisit it if there is no progress by Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections, but stopped short of congratulating him on his victory. Following certification of the election, Tymoshenko is likely to appeal within the legal five-day period. This will likely push back an inauguration date until early March.",Now

"Ft <body> Our clips service doesn't have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so here's the long awaited FT profile -you'll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview with Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most exciting for a generation - had never ended. But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of US leadership, one very much built around herself. She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones. In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage. Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip - and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a quarter of a million miles since taking office. On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day. So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week, talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out. ""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary."" She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration - by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions - go beyond that. Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies, toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel."" As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it. ""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word ""chunky"". Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying from a room. Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state, and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion."" State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo airport in March Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton, smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if demonstrating the size of a fish. Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise such a fundamental personal right"". Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the stage. Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty"" towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her - comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself. In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro- Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students. ""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States."" Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead and millions of dollars in the struggle against him. The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama administration When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from that searing experience to her new post. She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes."" Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is based on her performance in the job."" By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration - as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush. She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama. Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines but the trend lines."" It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office, she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine. But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades, when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had towards her. ""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details."" Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global challenges in the course of a day."" As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies. During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree with everything the Secretary said,"" he says. It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service. ""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high- stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding, but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives. ""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says. Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says. In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is sitting to one side in her office. ""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds. I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens."" ""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask. ""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea behind raising her domestic profile still further?"" Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections. Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton, long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever. Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour"" It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense - probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and overlapping forums - is real and right. You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me. That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself as well as at others. She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's essential to take part. There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague. David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly close"" A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven. Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which limited his ability to get things done in the wider world. Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world. That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy. Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area where she has really driven policy."" Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly"" Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department. That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats. When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly. This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing. Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises. We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office. Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

""Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare. Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community."" 2. ""I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall."" We obviously don't love the ""dept of state for development language,"" but what is most noteworthy is his emphasis on ""joined-up"" and ""integrated"" dept — underlining the fact that DFID as a separate cabinet department has been almost divorced from the rest of the government.

By Joe Conason • AP/Michael Sohn Former President Bill Clinton at the World Cup group C soccer match between the United States and Algeria in Pretoria, South Africa on Wednesday Salon's Joe Conason is traveling with Bill Clinton in Africa this week and was with the former president at today's U.S. World Cup soccer game in Pretoria. He filed this report: Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria, Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in. After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: ""I'm proud of you because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!"" Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to believe they had done it. The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse voice. As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of Team USA. Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens. ""If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,"" he said. ""It was a great game. You know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good heads and good hearts.""",Discard

Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington. Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression, outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel. That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel.

"H: All Still In Play, By The End Of Monday. Sid <body> sbwhoeop Monday, May 10, 2010 4:52 PM H H: All still in play, by end of Monday. Sid Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems. Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls, and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating. Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power. Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable, even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid",Later

There's nothing new and nothing encouraging in Iran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international community, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to the IAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran.

Yesterday, I had to speak at an event with the Congressional Women's Caucus on Maternal Health in Afghanistan. I said that as we were meeting in the Cannon Caucus Room , you were making a major maternal health announcement in Afghanistan. The women Members were overjoyed as were all the health advocates. This article from the Guardian was sent to me by a UK parliamentarian who intends to echo your remarks. Also, Andrea Mitchell did a great piece on your meeting with the women on NBC. > Hillary Clinton vows to defend rights of Afghan women > US secretary of state tells foreign ministers meeting in Kabul women 'will not be sacrificed' in any peace deal with the Taliban > Jon Boone in Kabul > Wednesday July 21 2010 > The Guardian > http://mvw.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/20/hillary-clinton-afghan-women-taliban > Jon Boone > Hillary Clinton today promised that any peace deal with the ultra-conservative Taliban movement would not come at the cost of the rights of Afghan women. > The US secretary of state told a conference of the world's foreign ministers that women in the country ""will not be sacrificed"" and announced a number of initiatives to improve their situation. > Her intervention came when many diplomats assume that any deal with hardline insurgents will inevitably involve compromises that would have been unthinkable nine years ago, when the US-led invasion of Afghanistan was in part justified by the desire to emancipate Afghan women. > But in a meeting with leading Afghan women today Clinton told them that any deal ""can't come at the cost of women and women's lives"". > ""We are aware of the concerns that many of you have expressed about the reconciliation process and we understand why you would have those concerns,"" Clinton told them. > Anxious to put the issue on the agenda of her fellow foreign ministers, she told the conference that women and civil society groups ""will be essential to this country's success."" > ""If these groups are fully empowered to help build a just and lasting peace, they will help do so,"" she said. ""If they are silenced and pushed to the margins of Afghan society, the prospects for peace and justice will be subverted."" > She also announced extra US funding for projects to improve maternal and child health, including one scheme that will use mullahs to encourage women to make use of clinics. In rural Afghan society, where they are often not allowed to leave the house without their husband's permission, women are sometimes discouraged from seeking medical care. > The final conference communique recognised ""the centrality of women's rights to the future of Afghanistan"". > Earlier this month, a report by Human Rights Watch said the Afghan government was already doing little to protect women and that their rights should be a priority in any political agreement with the Taliban. > The organisation said in areas under the control of militants, women suffer from violence and intimidation while girls' schools and female activists are attacked. The report identified one case where a female civil servant had to quit her job after receiving a ""night letter"" from insurgents threatening to kill her. > If you have any questions about this email, please contact the guardian.co.uk user help desk: userhelpguardian.co.uk.

" <body> Ebeling, Betsy Thursday, May 27, 2010 4:33 PM H ole0.bmp FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration Breaking down barriers Wednesday, May 26, 2010 By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann. To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name. When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region. On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds. She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization. The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania. Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,"" she said. Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations. A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models. Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare for people with disabilities. Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine. FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming ""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,"" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004. Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that people have been working on for years. ""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray. ""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee. ""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her."" Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order ""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds."" ""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts."" In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We have to keep the fire burning."" On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years, was promoted to executive director. ""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.""",Discard

On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland. In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this: ""From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu, Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the first Chinese-American to play in the NFL,"" said Clinton. Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, ""It felt good. She's a very important person, and so for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good."" Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5"", 250 pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football. >»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the first 15 minutes of practice ""It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football,"" said Wang.

"H: Fyi, To Discuss When You Came Up For Air... Sid <body> . Subject: H: fyi, to discuss when you come up for air... Sid http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.html Europe's New Politics of Fear by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010 There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's Parliament. Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed. Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is producing the same toxic politics. The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy. But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give ""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital."" Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month. But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right- wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles."" Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center- right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy, and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter. So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti- immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back. But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it. http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html B6 Eit What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in the process. by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010 amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left) leads today Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's. determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our camp's best candidate for 2012."" Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father. It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""), booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s. The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says. ""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says. Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of trying to build a new coalition government. Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual caricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American right is much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation to help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to public services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""access for all to the same level of health care."" Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was brought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician sent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you."" That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

"From Carlos Pascual <body> Please Pass to the Secretary Madame Secretary, A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims. U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August 20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to school while we complete this security review. I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate security. Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S. location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters. Carlos Pascual",Delegate

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups 13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential. FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note: ""After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century."" Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power. Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself, bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle. Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on. 74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world. POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states. Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,"" she told the Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better."" Anne-Marie Slaughter Director of Policy Planning U.S. Dept(silent of State (202) 647-2972",Later

I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our assistance. I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security risks involved. I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be helpful in drafting a response. In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or institution which might impede their ability to prevail. I had already planned a USAID/State meeting to address this issue this week.

"H:  The Boehner Poll. Sid <body> Did this with Sean. Sid The Political Scene Confounding Fathers The Tea Party's Cold War roots. by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010 ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties. A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said. For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with ""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the division of powers. During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear ""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders, which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one, on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised what America was."" Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today started with the Wilson Administration."" At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago, especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers. Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W. Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is, of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them. The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called ""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism."" The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military- intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense"" domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the opposite."" Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism."" In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new and modern concepts."" In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do."" The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states. Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I., from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position. Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from 1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the Mayor's lawn. After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the Mormons."") All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate"" appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax. In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations."" Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his organizations. Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy, which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings."" Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency. The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as the national motto. In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would think is worth a warm pitcher of spit."" By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in 2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue— it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102- level text. The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done""); and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book, commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world. Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate the desire for peace. Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day, and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then she can have no freedom of any sort whatever."" In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, ""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts, proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American history."" Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang, as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech, intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for ""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch Society has been doing it for over 50 years."" Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen- sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then, have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as ""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin. The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as paranoids and conspiracy-mongers. The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades, with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power. As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of ""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support. By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks"" lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in 1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy- washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York. Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge of Nixon's media operations. But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P. nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969, Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam, Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch Society. Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats' internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican Party and in national politics. In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford. After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford, demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right- winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had. As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda."" Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline, and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons."" Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give her its full backing. So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P. stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates; Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan. Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the coming midterm elections. In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. • Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz",Delegate

Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's hell. I can't stand it!' Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni. No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?' More... • France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up since he left Downing Street. Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids victims earlier this year. She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di', adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.' Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work, and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying. Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.' She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned a new page' after their marriage. Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on earth not to have noticed it.'

We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change. Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in our global response to climate change. These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund; create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation. The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue building on this progress. ###",Delegate
