"LIBYA <end> Associated Press <br/> Published September 21, 2012 <br/> BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the <br/> compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building <br/> Friday. <br/> In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the <br/> Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi. <br/> Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their <br/> weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias."" <br/> ""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to <br/> see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which <br/> protesters said was done in support of the army and police. <br/> No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed <br/> militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound. <br/> For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest <br/> problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the <br/> multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the <br/> regular armed forces and police. <br/> The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's <br/> revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals <br/> and carrying out killings. <br/> Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their <br/> hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which <br/> killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans. <br/> After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist <br/> militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were <br/> wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed. <br/> Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on <br/> Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah. <br/> ""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that <br/> militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,"" <br/> signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?"" <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739766 <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 <br/> STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER. <br/> Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend."" <br/> Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the <br/> protesters. <br/> The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of <br/> Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been <br/> unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled <br/> the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces. <br/> Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias. <br/> The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of <br/> Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a <br/> deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime. <br/> A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna. <br/> During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and <br/> ally itself with Al Qaeda. <br/> But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city. <br/> ""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim <br/> preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio <br/> show he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain."" <br/> Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias <br/> disband. <br/> Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no <br/> longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are <br/> killed. <br/> Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put <br/> an end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias. <br/> Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of <br/> elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked, <br/> reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and <br/> assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military. <br/> Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists. <br/> Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In <br/> the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare <br/> Western songs. <br/> And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name <br/> means ""Supporters of Shariah Law."" <br/> ""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam ben <br/> Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising <br/> against Qaddafi. ""This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah."" <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739766 <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 <br/> STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over <br/> heads,"" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner. <br/> One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell <br/> them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into <br/> the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over."" <br/> Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The <br/> armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police. <br/> So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to <br/> integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average <br/> police monthly salary of around $200. <br/> However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only <br/> prompted more militias to form. <br/> Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war <br/> against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several <br/> hundred thousand. <br/> ""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The <br/> government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster."" <br/> ### <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739766 <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 <br/> STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a <br/> major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this <br/> one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation <br/> with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political. <br/> The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair <br/> came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies, <br/> creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of <br/> non-military approaches. <br/> When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President <br/> George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was <br/> reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then, <br/> Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man <br/> could offer him. <br/> Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a <br/> military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed <br/> with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy <br/> approach. <br/> With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned <br/> about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to <br/> pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice.

NO FOIA WAIVER. <br/> the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this <br/> president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control. <br/> But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military <br/> answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and <br/> cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special <br/> ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the <br/> same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to <br/> employ which tactics to defeat the enemy? <br/> What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the <br/> other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and <br/> legal leverage. <br/> Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating <br/> lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was <br/> stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S. <br/> officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular <br/> government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind. <br/> The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core <br/> function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the <br/> secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone <br/> in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining <br/> an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at <br/> the helm of the CIA. <br/> Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of <br/> transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign <br/> policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart, <br/> adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be <br/> attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents. <br/> But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death <br/> of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive <br/> ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack. <br/> Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the <br/> region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment <br/> and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically <br/> untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled. <br/> And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a <br/> secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench. <br/> Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand, <br/> restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the <br/> current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle. <br/> Sarah Chayes, former special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. of Staff is a resident associate at the <br/> Carnegie Endowment and a contributing writer to Opinion. <br/> UNCLASSIFar <br/> EtiVright 2012, Los Angeles Times <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

POLITICO - MCCAIN AND HILLARY'S BIPARTISAN BOND <end> FYI <br/> ..........,Later
"COHEN POST <end> The Washington Post <br/> December 4, 2012 Tuesday <br/> Regional Edition <br/> SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25 <br/> HEADLINE: It's not about Rice <br/> BYLINE: Richard Cohen <br/> BODY: <br/> In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a <br/> leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in <br/> Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an <br/> investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his <br/> day. <br/> Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's <br/> and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having <br/> done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more <br/> at work. <br/> At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his <br/> Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn <br/> charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. <br/> She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate. <br/> But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were <br/> wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she. <br/> Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It <br/> was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a <br/> post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or <br/> incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed. <br/> I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great <br/> deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some <br/> others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential <br/> secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who <br/> has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is <br/> chairman. <br/> But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White <br/> House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739841 <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 <br/> STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER. <br/> job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most <br/> part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy. <br/> So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease <br/> about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's <br/> alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else <br/> (with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of <br/> unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an <br/> amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme. <br/> Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be <br/> dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become, <br/> but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee <br/> calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna <br/> administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya. <br/> This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much <br/> more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He <br/> sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for <br/> intervention, not just say it's too hard to do. <br/> The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this <br/> case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American <br/> power, not merely American politics. <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> Case No. F-2015-04841 <br/> Doc No. C05739841 <br/> Date: 05/13/2015 <br/> STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. <br/> SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"SPEECH/MIDDLE EAST <end> HRC: Back this morning from Asia. <br/> Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very <br/> positive. <br/> Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as <br/> I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are <br/> two ways: <br/> 1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a <br/> handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would <br/> represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it <br/> would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about <br/> our effectiveness. <br/> 2. The alternative would be for the administration to say: <br/> a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a <br/> settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development. <br/> b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of <br/> housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we <br/> have expressed to them.. <br/> •c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants <br/> an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help <br/> promote a two-state solution. <br/> This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move <br/> forward. <br/> Of course, I am around if you want to discuss. <br/> Good luck in India.

"AP/NK <end> Report: North Korea willing to hold talks with US AP <br/> By KWANG-TAE KIM <br/> Associated Press <br/> Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET <br/> SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report <br/> said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. ""We are not <br/> against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,"" Japan's Kyodo news agency <br/> quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in <br/> New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan, <br/> China and Russia, saying ""the six-party talks are gone forever."" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within <br/> the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last <br/> weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North <br/> Korea and the U.S. were slim. ""Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective <br/> approach"" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks ""cheated"" <br/> North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more <br/> details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the <br/> U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket <br/> launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range <br/> missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing <br/> international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's <br/> nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. ""North Korea will <br/> be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in <br/> Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State <br/> Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to ""small children"" demanding attention. At <br/> a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North ""has no friends left."" North Korea's Foreign <br/> Ministry described her Thursday as ""a funny lady"" who sometimes ""looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a <br/> pensioner going shopping."" <br/> 298",Later

Please let me know if you <br/> would like any further information. <br/> Thanks, <br/> Mike <br/> United States Institute of Peace: Background <br/> Proposals for the creation of a government ""peace"" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a ""Peace <br/> Office"" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to <br/> establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the <br/> Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known <br/> as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace <br/> academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board <br/> of Directors took place in 1986. <br/> The USIP Act established ""an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government <br/> through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace <br/> information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and <br/> peoples of the world without recourse to violence."" <br/> USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy <br/> research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country- <br/> specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include: <br/> ® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate <br/> dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and <br/> educating the public through events, films, and other outreach. <br/> O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries. <br/> ® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria, <br/> Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti. <br/> ® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional <br/> Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry. <br/> Michael H.

During our time in the White <br/> House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health <br/> coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care <br/> reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for <br/> all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in <br/> millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve <br/> America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki, <br/> and his incredible children and grandchildren.

"HOW ANTHONY WEINER HELPED THE PUBLIC OPTION RETURN FROM THE BRINK -- NEW YORK MAGAZINE <end> Magazine <br/> The Power Grid <br/> Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House, <br/> returned from the brink. <br/> •Published Oct 11, 2009 <br/> On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care <br/> bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the <br/> legislation instead. ""It's just too weak,"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real <br/> competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the <br/> bill. His political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead,"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus <br/> plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone <br/> gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more <br/> for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as <br/> Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to <br/> nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean <br/> into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest <br/> and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill <br/> eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care <br/> paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has <br/> been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have <br/> a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé <br/> and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious, <br/> wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in <br/> other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a <br/> matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship <br/> that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out there <br/> speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort <br/> with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town- <br/> hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum <br/> that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and <br/> death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of <br/> what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist; <br/> he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this <br/> has become my issue,"" Weiner says. ""If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows that <br/> he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the <br/> cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an <br/> equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a <br/> ""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House <br/> pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and <br/> 1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently <br/> clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that ""up to <br/> now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple <br/> of hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,"" he tells <br/> me. <br/> Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his <br/> consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to <br/> Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy",Discard

So he had <br/> no choice. <br/> That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza.

"MUBARAK POINTS <end> The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak <br/> Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo. <br/> While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree <br/> to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel <br/> has taken action on the ""five steps"" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3 <br/> with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and <br/> Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would <br/> seek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would <br/> present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy <br/> Envoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference <br/> (he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize <br/> that it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will <br/> realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.",Later

Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from <br/> across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and <br/> were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world, <br/> but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland. <br/> The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was <br/> one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy <br/> against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free <br/> people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around <br/> the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed. <br/> The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in <br/> the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss. <br/> My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",Delegate

Pages will also include a list effective messaging <br/> themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country. <br/> In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking <br/> guidance as to which additional countries should be covered.

As the only woman among the ""Big Six"" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a <br/> movement that changed our country forever. She organized the ""Wednesdays in Mississippi"" meetings that brought <br/> black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what <br/> she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know <br/> Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early <br/> days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example. <br/> From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust <br/> of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her <br/> accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the <br/> color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should <br/> have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for <br/> the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's <br/> family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to <br/> honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom <br/> gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.",Later

Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local <br/> insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth <br/> reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures <br/> to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a <br/> primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death <br/> eight school children last month. ""More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place,"" a <br/> commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have <br/> taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies",Later

"H: FYI, IRAN DOCUMENT GARY SICK SENT ME. SID <end> sbwhoeop <br/> Wednesday, March 24, 2010 11:11 PM <br/> h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid <br/> From Gary Sick <br/> Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of <br/> Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime <br/> and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his <br/> words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership. <br/> Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the <br/> statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have <br/> added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say. <br/> ""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the <br/> world ever more energetically..."" <br/> [real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and <br/> America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.] <br/> ""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally <br/> towards the United States..."" <br/> [Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we <br/> would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.] <br/> ""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their <br/> number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said <br/> that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did <br/> this happen? Of course not..."" <br/> [The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our <br/> favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i <br/> religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead <br/> of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal, <br/> and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a <br/> straight face when they behave this way!] <br/> ""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's] <br/> opposition towards the Iranian nation..."" <br/> [Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time <br/> we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the <br/> uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!] <br/> ""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and <br/> respected..."" <br/> [All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if <br/> Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.] <br/> ""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new <br/> friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them..."" <br/> [We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately <br/> expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the <br/> world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the <br/> good old days...]",Later

"CATHY ASHTON <end> As I mentioned last week, I was on a panel at the Brussels forum with Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call her <br/> Cathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, and Senator Voinovich. Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every <br/> turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most <br/> notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk <br/> (the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed, <br/> Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers <br/> meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state- <br/> building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development <br/> commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and <br/> then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the <br/> way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here. <br/> I hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY.

"AJAD SPEECH <end> Here's a basic summary: <br/> It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear <br/> weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability.

The speech made several pointed <br/> attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us <br/> ""the most hated"" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used <br/> nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 ""proposals"", most of which were previewed <br/> in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with <br/> nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC. <br/> The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.",Later

"FYI <end> SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN <br/> The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military <br/> operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts <br/> which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their <br/> families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The <br/> Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and <br/> wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The <br/> Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into <br/> the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international <br/> standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the <br/> importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at <br/> the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as <br/> well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council <br/> underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties <br/> and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in <br/> peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses <br/> support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway <br/> and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners <br/> to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.",Later

"FT <end> Our clips service doesn't have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so here's the long awaited FT <br/> profile -you'll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote: <br/> An FT interview with Hillary Clinton <br/> By Daniel Dombey <br/> FT <br/> June 11 2010 22:21 <br/> This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed <br/> streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that <br/> has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most <br/> exciting for a generation - had never ended. <br/> But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not <br/> South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what <br/> the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might <br/> suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of <br/> US leadership, one very much built around herself. <br/> She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall <br/> tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised <br/> arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones. <br/> In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays <br/> that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while <br/> Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a <br/> born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and <br/> local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage. <br/> Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it <br/> to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip - <br/> and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed <br/> bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a <br/> quarter of a million miles since taking office. <br/> On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four <br/> countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a <br/> shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we <br/> don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day. <br/> So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week, <br/> talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out. <br/> ""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister <br/> or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her <br/> expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a <br/> vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of <br/> leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary."" <br/> She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration <br/> - by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a <br/> battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is <br/> ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the <br/> foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions - <br/> go beyond that. <br/> Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies, <br/> toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and <br/> for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we <br/> had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel."" <br/> As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a <br/> cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still <br/> hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State <br/> Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and <br/> unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of <br/> state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's <br/> been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it. <br/> ""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how <br/> else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word <br/> ""chunky"". <br/> Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner <br/> of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known <br/> less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who <br/> retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying <br/> from a room. <br/> Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state, <br/> and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. <br/> Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most <br/> substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who <br/> served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential <br/> stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders <br/> want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion."" <br/> State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo <br/> airport in March <br/> Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of <br/> traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her <br/> dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous <br/> young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton, <br/> smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female <br/> student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she <br/> emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if <br/> demonstrating the size of a fish. <br/> Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into <br/> treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just <br/> expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women <br/> have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden <br/> as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise <br/> such a fundamental personal right"". <br/> Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we <br/> might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was <br/> sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton <br/> doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without <br/> appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight <br/> ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is <br/> the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the <br/> podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her <br/> satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the <br/> stage. <br/> Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty"" <br/> towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her - <br/> comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the <br/> foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself. <br/> In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive <br/> discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro- <br/> Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students. <br/> ""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so <br/> that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before <br/> speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She <br/> says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it <br/> demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States."" <br/> Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome <br/> statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead <br/> and millions of dollars in the struggle against him. <br/> The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama <br/> administration <br/> When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the <br/> obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're <br/> working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to <br/> me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run <br/> inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from <br/> that searing experience to her new post. <br/> She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the <br/> Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do <br/> something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won <br/> and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes."" <br/> Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton <br/> has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than <br/> before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised <br/> that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is <br/> based on her performance in the job."" <br/> By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good <br/> working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an <br/> alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is <br/> Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been <br/> popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration - <br/> as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both. <br/> In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's <br/> Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he <br/> is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt <br/> Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush. <br/> She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of <br/> Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama. <br/> Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides <br/> say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill <br/> Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a <br/> kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines <br/> but the trend lines."" <br/> It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the <br/> chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office, <br/> she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying <br/> and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine. <br/> But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades, <br/> when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable <br/> are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but <br/> needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a <br/> smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had <br/> towards her. <br/> ""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the <br/> most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he <br/> calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of <br/> work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details."" <br/> Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She <br/> has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her <br/> confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the <br/> meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She <br/> herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her <br/> campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around <br/> all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the <br/> way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze <br/> a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city <br/> four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your <br/> audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global <br/> challenges in the course of a day."" <br/> As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of <br/> international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of <br/> important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey, <br/> Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She <br/> says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the <br/> US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and <br/> over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid <br/> questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies. <br/> During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the <br/> country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to <br/> secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her <br/> cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign <br/> minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to <br/> Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to <br/> avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions <br/> on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree <br/> with everything the Secretary said,"" he says. <br/> It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the <br/> United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers <br/> described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's <br/> preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in <br/> her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service. <br/> ""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the <br/> frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high- <br/> stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the <br/> arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding, <br/> but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to <br/> coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives. <br/> ""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she <br/> gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that <br/> you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says. <br/> Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica <br/> Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many <br/> other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not <br/> just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and <br/> the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says. <br/> In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she <br/> says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do <br/> my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is <br/> sitting to one side in her office. <br/> ""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds. <br/> I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by <br/> talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will <br/> only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I <br/> ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that, <br/> obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens."" <br/> ""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask. <br/> ""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I <br/> think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women <br/> who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to <br/> run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US <br/> official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with <br/> electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea <br/> behind raising her domestic profile still further?"" <br/> Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say <br/> she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections. <br/> Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The <br/> journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard <br/> road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather <br/> fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton, <br/> long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever. <br/> Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent <br/> David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour"" <br/> It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is <br/> laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense - <br/> probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is <br/> essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and <br/> overlapping forums - is real and right. <br/> You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers <br/> meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have <br/> turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me. <br/> That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her <br/> hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great <br/> sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself <br/> as well as at others. <br/> She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks <br/> strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in <br/> a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a <br/> necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's <br/> essential to take part. <br/> There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the <br/> people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in <br/> trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why <br/> so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague. <br/> David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary <br/> Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly <br/> close"" <br/> A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give <br/> her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven. <br/> Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless <br/> bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in <br/> promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry <br/> Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him <br/> all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely <br/> admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which <br/> limited his ability to get things done in the wider world. <br/> Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so <br/> damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the <br/> campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the <br/> White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton <br/> appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is <br/> rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign <br/> capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than <br/> anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world. <br/> That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have <br/> been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy. <br/> Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and <br/> says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area <br/> where she has really driven policy."" <br/> Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist <br/> David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly"" <br/> Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued <br/> his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with <br/> other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department. <br/> That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise <br/> of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy <br/> structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with <br/> private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats. <br/> When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly. <br/> This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing. <br/> Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the <br/> most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the <br/> situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely <br/> difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of <br/> emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises. <br/> We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to <br/> one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to <br/> work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of <br/> those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office. <br/> Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature <br/> issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level. <br/> David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise in <br/> national security",Delegate

"THE BIGGER STORY HERE IS THE INTERNAL REVOLT AGAINST MCCHRYSTAL. SID <end> The Runaway General <br/> Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, <br/> has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the <br/> real enemy: The wimps in the White House <br/> By Michael Hastings <br/> Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT <br/> This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010. <br/> 'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April, <br/> and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in <br/> Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually <br/> have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United <br/> States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president <br/> and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to <br/> keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him. <br/> ""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn. <br/> McChrystal turns sharply in his chair. <br/> ""Hey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?"" <br/> McChrystal gives him the middle finger. <br/> The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations <br/> center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet, <br/> hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian <br/> casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his <br/> advisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any <br/> place with candles on the tables as too ""Gucci."" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega <br/> Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt <br/> comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the <br/> Pentagon's most secretive black ops. <br/> ""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car <br/> bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban. <br/> ""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says. <br/> McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in <br/> Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or <br/> disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice. <br/> ""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says. <br/> He pauses a beat. <br/> ""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it."" <br/> With that, he's out the door. <br/> ""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides. <br/> ""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay."" <br/> The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French <br/> military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes <br/> with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss <br/> off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he <br/> gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as <br/> ""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president <br/> himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal <br/> seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile <br/> Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get <br/> today, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says. <br/> Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one- <br/> liner. <br/> ""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?"" <br/> ""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?"" <br/> When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign <br/> promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want the <br/> American people to understand,"" he announced in March 2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle <br/> and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since <br/> the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David <br/> McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had <br/> met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in <br/> more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War. <br/> Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The <br/> general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials <br/> in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama <br/> looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the <br/> Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minute <br/> photo op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy <br/> who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."" <br/> From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a <br/> controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the <br/> Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of <br/> fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the <br/> enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a <br/> process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially <br/> rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare: <br/> Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his <br/> ""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials. <br/> Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution <br/> for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it. <br/> As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists <br/> in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out. <br/> After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary <br/> Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another <br/> 40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure."" <br/> The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak <br/> on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was <br/> determined to kick the president's ass. <br/> Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in <br/> Afghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling an <br/> unsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against <br/> experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in <br/> Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entire <br/> COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading <br/> critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trillion <br/> dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense. <br/> In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the <br/> president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic <br/> crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan. <br/> Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops <br/> to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly, <br/> behind the counterinsurgency crowd. <br/> Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak. <br/> In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions <br/> of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S. <br/> troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that <br/> began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it <br/> as a ""bleeding ulcer."" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and <br/> Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The <br/> president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even <br/> though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he <br/> didn't want. <br/> Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to <br/> accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smell <br/> like a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is going <br/> to end in an argument."" <br/> The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists, <br/> around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she <br/> has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has <br/> invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gucci"" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised. <br/> ""He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh. <br/> The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs. <br/> There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two <br/> fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as <br/> Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves <br/> on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about <br/> changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had <br/> taken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol on <br/> base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands <br/> of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub <br/> modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary <br/> for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend <br/> around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a <br/> staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man <br/> single-handedly winning the war. <br/> By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps <br/> from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own <br/> invention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song. <br/> McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd die <br/> for me."" <br/> The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group <br/> represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable <br/> command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an <br/> assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special <br/> Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary <br/> Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into <br/> the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call <br/> the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,"" <br/> says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannot <br/> by itself create governance reform."" <br/> Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State <br/> Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit <br/> about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and <br/> veteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide, <br/> ""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk <br/> shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""Hillary <br/> had Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'"" <br/> McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss says <br/> he's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to <br/> get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp <br/> onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit."" <br/> At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" he groans. ""I <br/> don't even want to open it."" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in <br/> his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance. <br/> ""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail. <br/> By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador. <br/> According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and <br/> 2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by <br/> NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the <br/> diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively <br/> increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filled <br/> by an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations. <br/> The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New <br/> York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's <br/> strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether the <br/> counterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with no <br/> way to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and <br/> chaos."" <br/> McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said <br/> anything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""Here's one that covers his <br/> flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'"" <br/> The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not <br/> diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead <br/> Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered <br/> credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied <br/> the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar. <br/> In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get <br/> him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the <br/> president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted <br/> the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap. <br/> This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government <br/> puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his <br/> cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""He's been locked up in his <br/> palace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined <br/> McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S. <br/> soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we were <br/> fighting in Uruzgan!"" <br/> Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him <br/> throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all <br/> joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he <br/> made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a <br/> fastball down the middle. <br/> McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the <br/> last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the Hudson,"" as it was known then, was a <br/> potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights, <br/> and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or <br/> mud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to <br/> serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and <br/> ""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S. <br/> forces in Iraq. <br/> The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to <br/> thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more <br/> than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a <br/> ""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after <br/> downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours <br/> subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'd <br/> end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal <br/> in 1973. <br/> McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as <br/> brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary <br/> magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his <br/> career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year- <br/> old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator <br/> appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the <br/> assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: ""The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the <br/> raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded."" <br/> After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We really <br/> felt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal."" <br/> So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental <br/> commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen <br/> Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who <br/> want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers <br/> outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts, <br/> required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance <br/> with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks. <br/> In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of <br/> Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks <br/> of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as <br/> a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting <br/> tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that <br/> followed September 11th. ""He was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he <br/> wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years."" <br/> By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman <br/> during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander <br/> with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens"" <br/> remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission <br/> Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint — <br/> overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part <br/> in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man. <br/> After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April <br/> 2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He <br/> signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire. <br/> (McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander <br/> known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command, <br/> specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances of <br/> Corporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president. <br/> ""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother, <br/> Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""golden <br/> boy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping <br/> the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general. <br/> Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in <br/> Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of <br/> abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even <br/> though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so <br/> unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in <br/> Afghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for <br/> his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the <br/> scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in <br/> Afghanistan. <br/> The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a <br/> dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek called <br/> him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor <br/> rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on <br/> his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name <br/> and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus, <br/> and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq, <br/> unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fucking <br/> lads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone <br/> would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal."" <br/> It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite <br/> forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of <br/> insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen. <br/> Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist <br/> networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned <br/> by the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT, <br/> sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal <br/> in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help. <br/> You got to work together with these guys.'"" <br/> Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts <br/> of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from <br/> four to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the <br/> hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the general <br/> frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this <br/> year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created <br/> tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special <br/> Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests <br/> erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number of <br/> people,"" McChrystal recently conceded. <br/> Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that <br/> the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math,"" as he calls it — for every innocent person you <br/> kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air <br/> power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates <br/> commanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while,"" says one U.S. official, ""the most dangerous place to be in <br/> Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make <br/> not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint,"" a <br/> buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military. <br/> But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own <br/> troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special <br/> Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of <br/> engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."" <br/> In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront <br/> such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had <br/> received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit. <br/> ""I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,"" Arroyo <br/> wrote. <br/> Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is <br/> something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend <br/> upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's <br/> outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live <br/> operation in a dangerous war zone. <br/> Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year- <br/> old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED <br/> a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general <br/> would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you,"" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to <br/> make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible. <br/> The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM <br/> to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard <br/> towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen <br/> some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had <br/> repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a <br/> combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been <br/> denied. ""These were abandoned houses,"" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them."" <br/> One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably <br/> certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,"" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has <br/> traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't <br/> have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking <br/> bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"" <br/> The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of <br/> command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck, when I came over here and <br/> heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,"" says Hicks, who has served three tours <br/> of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his <br/> bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because <br/> somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this <br/> thing."" <br/> McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two <br/> dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to <br/> understand the big picture as well,"" McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for <br/> yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says. <br/> ""Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,"" says Hicks. <br/> McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,"" he tells the men. ""You're leading by example. <br/> That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about <br/> counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense, <br/> but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year,"" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no <br/> longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do, either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any <br/> hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,"" McChrystal tries to joke. <br/> ""But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies."" <br/> During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use <br/> lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they <br/> did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,"" one soldier says. <br/> ""Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,"" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't <br/> kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work."" <br/> ""I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,"" the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the <br/> insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's <br/> getting."" <br/> ""I agree with you,"" McChrystal says. ""In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here, <br/> you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out <br/> here and resettle it?"" <br/> A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a <br/> civilian. ""That's the way this game is,"" McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill <br/> all the shirts."" <br/> As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one <br/> last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier,"" he tells <br/> them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job. <br/> Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold <br/> President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it. <br/> When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here <br/> was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny. <br/> The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent <br/> memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975). <br/> McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy, <br/> expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,"" he says. But even if he somehow manages to <br/> succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to <br/> shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools, <br/> roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying <br/> Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical, politically,"" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA <br/> case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us <br/> there."" <br/> In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by <br/> Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in <br/> Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the <br/> praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian <br/> casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the • <br/> session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no <br/> denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic <br/> development,"" the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been <br/> visible just a few years earlier."" <br/> It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no <br/> real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first <br/> impressions,"" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many <br/> lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of <br/> progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have <br/> mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even <br/> defined or recognizable,"" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political <br/> adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is <br/> to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become <br/> great in the near future."" <br/> But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those <br/> closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things <br/> are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"" <br/> a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from <br/> dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its <br/> counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next <br/> summer if we see success here,"" a senior military official in Kabul tells me. <br/> Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress,"" <br/> McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning <br/> to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original <br/> home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that <br/> McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more <br/> groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like <br/> Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and <br/> army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city <br/> to win over the civilian population. <br/> Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation,"" says a <br/> U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials <br/> insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja. <br/> ""The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,"" says a military official. ""We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way <br/> that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders <br/> say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall. <br/> ""This looks like CT-plus!"" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. <br/> Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years <br/> of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that <br/> COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his <br/> influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things <br/> worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,"" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who <br/> has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government <br/> and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility <br/> among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the <br/> primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using <br/> the word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with <br/> Stanley McChrystal in charge. <br/> This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.",Now

""Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development <br/> agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the <br/> key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare. <br/> Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community."" <br/> 2. ""I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department <br/> of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I <br/> won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall."" <br/> We obviously don't love the ""dept of state for development language,"" but what is most <br/> noteworthy is his emphasis on ""joined-up"" and ""integrated"" dept — underlining the fact that <br/> DFID as a separate cabinet department has been almost divorced from the rest of the <br/> government. <br/> Anne-Marie Slaughter <br/> Director of Policy Planning <br/> U.S. Department of State <br/> (202) 647-2972",Later

He filed this report: <br/> Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria, <br/> Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry <br/> McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former <br/> president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in. <br/> After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: ""I'm proud of you <br/> because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!"" <br/> Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to <br/> believe they had done it. <br/> The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with <br/> a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse <br/> voice. <br/> As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players <br/> chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of <br/> Team USA. <br/> Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens. <br/> ""If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,"" he said. ""It was a great game. You <br/> know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good <br/> heads and good hearts.""",Discard

The women Members were overjoyed as were all the health advocates. <br/> This article from the Guardian was sent to me by a UK parliamentarian who intends to echo your remarks. Also, Andrea <br/> Mitchell did a great piece on your meeting with the women on NBC. <br/> > Hillary Clinton vows to defend rights of Afghan women <br/> > US secretary of state tells foreign ministers meeting in Kabul women 'will not be sacrificed' in any peace deal with the <br/> Taliban <br/> > Jon Boone in Kabul <br/> > Wednesday July 21 2010 <br/> > The Guardian <br/> > http://mvw.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/20/hillary-clinton-afghan-women-taliban <br/> > Jon Boone <br/> > Hillary Clinton today promised that any peace deal with the ultra-conservative Taliban movement would not come at the <br/> cost of the rights of Afghan women. <br/> > The US secretary of state told a conference of the world's foreign ministers that women in the country ""will not be <br/> sacrificed"" and announced a number of initiatives to improve their situation. <br/> > Her intervention came when many diplomats assume that any deal with hardline insurgents will inevitably involve <br/> compromises that would have been unthinkable nine years ago, when the US-led invasion of Afghanistan was in part <br/> justified by the desire to emancipate Afghan women. <br/> > But in a meeting with leading Afghan women today Clinton told them that any deal ""can't come at the cost of women and <br/> women's lives"". <br/> > ""We are aware of the concerns that many of you have expressed about the reconciliation process and we understand <br/> why you would have those concerns,"" Clinton told them. <br/> > Anxious to put the issue on the agenda of her fellow foreign ministers, she told the conference that women and civil <br/> society groups ""will be essential to this country's success."" <br/> > ""If these groups are fully empowered to help build a just and lasting peace, they will help do so,"" she said. ""If they are <br/> silenced and pushed to the margins of Afghan society, the prospects for peace and justice will be subverted."" <br/> > She also announced extra US funding for projects to improve maternal and child health, including one scheme that will <br/> use mullahs to encourage women to make use of clinics. In rural Afghan society, where they are often not allowed to <br/> leave the house without their husband's permission, women are sometimes discouraged from seeking medical care. <br/> > The final conference communique recognised ""the centrality of women's rights to the future of Afghanistan"". <br/> > Earlier this month, a report by Human Rights Watch said the Afghan government was already doing little to protect <br/> women and that their rights should be a priority in any political agreement with the Taliban. <br/> > The organisation said in areas under the control of militants, women suffer from violence and intimidation while girls' <br/> schools and female activists are attacked. The report identified one case where a female civil servant had to quit her job <br/> after receiving a ""night letter"" from insurgents threatening to kill her. <br/> > If you have any questions about this email, please contact the guardian.co.uk user help desk: <br/> userhelpguardian.co.uk. <br/> Get a new e-mail account with Hotmail - Free.

" <end> Ebeling, Betsy <br/> Thursday, May 27, 2010 4:33 PM <br/> H <br/> ole0.bmp <br/> FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration <br/> Breaking down barriers <br/> Wednesday, May 26, 2010 <br/> By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette <br/> Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette <br/> FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, <br/> Kristy Trautmann. <br/> To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name. <br/> When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in <br/> August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but <br/> influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in <br/> our region. <br/> On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with <br/> far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and <br/> by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds. <br/> She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds <br/> from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit <br/> organization. <br/> The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, <br/> an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville <br/> Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people <br/> with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania. <br/> Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and <br/> ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the <br/> impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused <br/> foundation,"" she said. <br/> Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million <br/> has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations. <br/> A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with <br/> disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national <br/> models. <br/> Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. <br/> Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical <br/> staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money <br/> for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first <br/> such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare <br/> for people with disabilities. <br/> Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at <br/> Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for <br/> Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine. <br/> FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more <br/> accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming <br/> ""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the <br/> issues we have,"" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based <br/> in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004. <br/> Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped <br/> solve are ones that people have been working on for years. <br/> ""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders <br/> together to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray. <br/> ""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, <br/> leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA <br/> and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee. <br/> ""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the <br/> community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, <br/> and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her."" <br/> Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order <br/> ""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds."" <br/> ""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned <br/> something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's <br/> ideas and efforts."" <br/> In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A <br/> new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We <br/> have to keep the fire burning."" <br/> On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program <br/> director for six years, was promoted to executive director. <br/> ""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the <br/> foundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know <br/> that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the <br/> populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.""",Discard

And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the <br/> first Chinese-American to play in the NFL,"" said Clinton. <br/> Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, ""It felt good. She's a very important person, and so <br/> for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good."" <br/> Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5"", 250 <br/> pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track <br/> and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football. <br/> >»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the <br/> first 15 minutes of practice <br/> ""It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but <br/> at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football,"" said Wang. <br/> Wang is expected to make the team, and his goal is to make a difference.",Delegate

Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for <br/> their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the <br/> Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In <br/> Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire <br/> world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its <br/> leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's <br/> Parliament. <br/> Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to <br/> anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed. <br/> Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the <br/> first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is <br/> producing the same toxic politics. <br/> The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much <br/> more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being <br/> helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be <br/> paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy. <br/> But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give <br/> ""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital."" <br/> Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The <br/> Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish <br/> origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical <br/> Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the <br/> Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a <br/> general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is <br/> suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month. <br/> But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right- <br/> wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, <br/> Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II <br/> when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles."" <br/> Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center- <br/> right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany, <br/> Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy, <br/> and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held <br/> Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish <br/> capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter. <br/> So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti- <br/> immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to <br/> appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living <br/> and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back. <br/> But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it. <br/> http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html <br/> B6 <br/> Eit <br/> What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe <br/> Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right <br/> party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in <br/> the process. <br/> by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010 <br/> amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux <br/> Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left) <br/> leads today <br/> Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate <br/> fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking <br/> to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party <br/> feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting <br/> the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these <br/> youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's. <br/> determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament <br/> necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our <br/> camp's best candidate for 2012."" <br/> Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's <br/> expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong <br/> French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a <br/> fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a <br/> new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father. <br/> It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and <br/> cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began <br/> after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in <br/> elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So <br/> he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking <br/> citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""), <br/> booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His <br/> abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s. <br/> The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says. <br/> ""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a <br/> creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front <br/> wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's <br/> rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says. <br/> Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister <br/> Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them <br/> the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out <br/> between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly <br/> Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of <br/> trying to build a new coalition government. <br/> Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual <br/> caricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American right <br/> is much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers <br/> more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation <br/> to help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to public <br/> services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""access for all to <br/> the same level of health care."" <br/> Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by <br/> competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the <br/> family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was <br/> brought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician <br/> sent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you."" <br/> That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential <br/> race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer. <br/> With Barbie Nadeau in Rome",Discard

An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an <br/> attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families <br/> were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a <br/> very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims. <br/> U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on <br/> understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in <br/> Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August <br/> 20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to <br/> school while we complete this security review. <br/> I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey.

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective <br/> roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups <br/> 13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton <br/> for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential. <br/> FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK <br/> SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON <br/> Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note: <br/> ""After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say <br/> it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century."" <br/> Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and <br/> the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power. <br/> Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global <br/> Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself, <br/> bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic <br/> solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to <br/> rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he <br/> spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle. <br/> Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an <br/> accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's <br/> temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the <br/> objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's <br/> poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and <br/> Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is <br/> what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on. <br/> 74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter <br/> for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world. <br/> POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON <br/> Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the <br/> United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell <br/> largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is <br/> spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate <br/> marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in <br/> which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states. <br/> Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New <br/> American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both <br/> candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own <br/> quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate <br/> needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan <br/> strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,"" she told <br/> the Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better."" <br/> Anne-Marie Slaughter <br/> Director of Policy Planning <br/> U.S. Dept(silent of State <br/> (202) 647-2972",Later

"H:  THE BOEHNER POLL. SID <end> Did this with Sean. Sid <br/> The Political Scene <br/> Confounding Fathers <br/> The Tea Party's Cold War roots. <br/> by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010 <br/> ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties. <br/> A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite <br/> props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the <br/> stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and <br/> Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of <br/> history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he <br/> explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our <br/> history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the <br/> history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the <br/> nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught <br/> one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said. <br/> For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon <br/> convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by <br/> Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely <br/> as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own <br/> institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with <br/> ""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist <br/> federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the <br/> division of powers. <br/> During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear <br/> ""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three <br/> members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at <br/> Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders, <br/> which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one, <br/> on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons <br/> about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the <br/> early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and <br/> the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised <br/> what America was."" <br/> Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom <br/> Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow <br/> Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from <br/> Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today <br/> started with the Wilson Administration."" <br/> At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an <br/> unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is <br/> audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of <br/> conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago, <br/> especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers. <br/> Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W. <br/> Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is, <br/> of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American <br/> history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist <br/> China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades <br/> inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to <br/> challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them. <br/> The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist <br/> violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time <br/> deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called <br/> ""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which <br/> claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a <br/> fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he <br/> resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing <br/> propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom <br/> Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly <br/> liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism."" <br/> The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert <br/> Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military- <br/> intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the <br/> Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's <br/> followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was <br/> estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense"" <br/> domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract <br/> titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist <br/> conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he <br/> accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the <br/> opposite."" <br/> Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of <br/> totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik <br/> Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an <br/> enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's <br/> role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one <br/> man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism."" <br/> In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total <br/> conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth <br/> century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the <br/> conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government <br/> agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the <br/> Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they <br/> had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these <br/> conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist <br/> theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new <br/> and modern concepts."" <br/> In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a <br/> nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the <br/> Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the <br/> populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the <br/> courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do."" <br/> The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and <br/> professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most <br/> demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group <br/> became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly <br/> to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a <br/> humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states. <br/> Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A <br/> transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early <br/> nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted <br/> that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who <br/> are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I., <br/> from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed <br/> implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he <br/> had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position. <br/> Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from <br/> 1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card <br/> game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half <br/> truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the <br/> Mayor's lawn. <br/> After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an <br/> exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion <br/> Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which <br/> condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later <br/> defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the <br/> Mormons."") <br/> All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer <br/> published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser <br/> Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first <br/> Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate"" <br/> appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds <br/> could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the <br/> Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller <br/> Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like <br/> the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the <br/> Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax. <br/> In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for <br/> Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets <br/> included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal <br/> Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold <br/> standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social <br/> security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations."" <br/> Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing <br/> fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone <br/> off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and <br/> making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously <br/> close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations <br/> and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his <br/> organizations. <br/> Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations <br/> and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that <br/> the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often <br/> described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander <br/> Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid <br/> book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of <br/> what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of <br/> wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas <br/> Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy, <br/> which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made <br/> a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings."" <br/> Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle <br/> gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional <br/> Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first <br/> permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency. <br/> The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as <br/> the national motto. <br/> In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and <br/> prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative <br/> study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California <br/> Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from <br/> long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and <br/> suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of <br/> Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would <br/> think is worth a warm pitcher of spit."" <br/> By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in <br/> 2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000 <br/> Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After <br/> Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue— <br/> it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand <br/> copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country <br/> have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding <br/> Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is <br/> the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102- <br/> level text. <br/> The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an <br/> audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience <br/> that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that <br/> patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck <br/> described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal <br/> Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign <br/> Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done""); <br/> and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow <br/> Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a <br/> diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book, <br/> commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful <br/> bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world. <br/> Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing <br/> of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old <br/> Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was <br/> the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the <br/> ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor <br/> Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate <br/> the desire for peace. <br/> Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he <br/> was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day, <br/> and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big <br/> business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent <br/> American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies <br/> in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then <br/> she can have no freedom of any sort whatever."" <br/> In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society <br/> spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, <br/> ""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I <br/> thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His <br/> guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been <br/> out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts, <br/> proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on <br/> Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American <br/> history."" <br/> Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under <br/> President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for <br/> a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M. <br/> Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang, <br/> as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our <br/> fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech, <br/> intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for <br/> ""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch <br/> Society has been doing it for over 50 years."" <br/> Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen- <br/> sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then, <br/> have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative <br/> Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron <br/> Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John <br/> Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as <br/> ""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested <br/> that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in <br/> the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during <br/> Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the <br/> minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal <br/> Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big <br/> government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin. <br/> The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half <br/> century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in <br/> November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of <br/> extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with <br/> Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as <br/> paranoids and conspiracy-mongers. <br/> The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor <br/> of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph <br/> McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was <br/> set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical <br/> conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to <br/> worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even <br/> Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades, <br/> with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that <br/> succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power. <br/> As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be <br/> expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their <br/> fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch <br/> Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the <br/> conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of <br/> ""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the <br/> magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support. <br/> By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and <br/> he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged <br/> Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks"" <br/> lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious <br/> to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in <br/> 1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no <br/> vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" <br/> In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats <br/> succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's <br/> Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was <br/> undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon <br/> among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently <br/> been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy- <br/> washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York. <br/> Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had <br/> established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official <br/> at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we <br/> ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National <br/> Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge <br/> of Nixon's media operations. <br/> But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of <br/> the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P. <br/> nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom <br/> Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969, <br/> Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious <br/> appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place <br/> later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam, <br/> Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives <br/> were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch <br/> Society. <br/> Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The <br/> conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's <br/> second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats' <br/> internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference <br/> toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read <br/> the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican <br/> Party and in national politics. <br/> In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford. <br/> After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a <br/> shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford, <br/> demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of <br/> Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His <br/> pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the <br/> relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision <br/> dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican <br/> moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right- <br/> winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who <br/> understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had. <br/> As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen <br/> Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style <br/> government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He <br/> appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief <br/> of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy <br/> adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and <br/> Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights <br/> legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan <br/> skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail <br/> Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed <br/> forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet <br/> propaganda."" <br/> Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the <br/> federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the <br/> standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to <br/> matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline, <br/> and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of <br/> extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal <br/> calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of <br/> attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to <br/> check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom <br/> DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even <br/> though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first <br/> to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for <br/> his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial <br/> collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a <br/> conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and <br/> builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and <br/> resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is <br/> now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons."" <br/> Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former <br/> speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the <br/> Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the <br/> congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a <br/> vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the <br/> campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had <br/> bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the <br/> Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox <br/> News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine <br/> O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from <br/> Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a <br/> huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give <br/> her its full backing. <br/> So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as <br/> Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P. <br/> stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates; <br/> Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the <br/> Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan. <br/> Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White <br/> House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the <br/> left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove <br/> too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of <br/> government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a <br/> massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush <br/> political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly <br/> supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a <br/> recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a <br/> Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the <br/> coming midterm elections. <br/> In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social <br/> and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's <br/> on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the <br/> same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a <br/> degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For <br/> defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. • <br/> Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz",Delegate

"CANCUN STATEMENT FOR YOUR SIGN OFF <end> STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON <br/> The Cancun Agreements <br/> Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the <br/> climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the <br/> Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at <br/> mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change. <br/> Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions <br/> under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in <br/> our global response to climate change. <br/> These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation <br/> pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and <br/> Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund; <br/> create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a <br/> framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation. <br/> The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United <br/> States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue <br/> building on this progress. <br/> ###",Delegate
