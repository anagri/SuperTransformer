Slide # 1 = Team Intro
hello everyone

welcome to the app demo of SuperTransformer

an AI assisted email inbox manager, to make you productive, efficient and effective

the team members of team Megatron are -
Amir, that is myself
Abhishek and Amogh

=======

Slide #2 = App Intro

SuperTransformer allows you to intelligently categorize your emails into actionable labels, based on your feedback and training

You spend less time triaging through your emails, minimal time responding to critical ones, and more time focussed on your work

=======

Slide #3 = Send Email to test.hillary0@gmail.com

Praying to the demo gods, let me up the game a little

Please send an email to test.hillary0@gmail.com

You can chose one of the subject lines listed here, or from your inbox, chose a use a subject line of less confidential email

Your email body can be empty, or just repeat the subject line there

I'll pause for 30 secs while you do it

=======

Slide #4 = Eisenhower Matrix

SuperTransformer utilizes productivity techniques for prioritization like Eisenhower Matrix

Eisenhower Matrix categorizes tasks into Important and Urgent, and specifies action that can be taken

Important and Urgent = Do it Now
Important but not Urgent = Do Later
Not important but Urgent = Delegate
Not important or Urgent = Discard

=======

Slide #5 = Inbox Zero

Inbox zero is also losely based on Eisenhower Matrix

=======

Slide #6 = David Allen

So is David Allen's Get It Done

You have single inbox, then you categorize it based on importance

Many of these techniques requires you to manually triage the task for importance and urgency. We plan to solve this problem and automate it

=======

Slide #7: App Development Details

The app demo uses persona and email data of ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Clinton being the topmost executive of State Department needs to be highly efficient to be effective at her job

We chose this persona because we have Clinton emails declassified and publicly available from US Govt

This helps us apply our theories on real world data and produce result useful in real world scenarios

We use Label Studio to annotate the Email dump into 4 priorities - Now, Later, Delegate, Discard

We also label email as Ignore if data is not properly parsed

We apply our own understanding of Geo-politics to label a priority for an email based on its Subject and Body

We then use Cohere to train a classify model to classify into above 4 categories given an email subject and body

We use Glitch to host APIs and Simple Demo UI

We use Pipedream as IFTTT, it triggers when a new email arrives, queries the cohere API via Glitch and then uses GMail API to apply the predicted label

=======

Live Demo

Now we will show you a live demo of how SuperTransformer works

Here is a simulated inbox of secretary clinton, there are no priorites marked and looks cluttered

Now I will manually trigger the workflow, in production it can be scheduled to run every minute

Let's give it a minute to fetch all the new emails and label it based on our predictions

Let's see our inbox now, we have all the emails labeled by priority
It is less cluttered and clearly marks the priority based on our preferences

Slide #8 - App Demo

If you want to try it out on your own, you can use this URL

DO = use the demo UI with dummy data

=======

Slide #11 - Challenges

Some of the challenges we faced are listed here

The emails were available as pdf, without any uniform strucutre, so lot of parsing misses, as well as many emails were heavily redacted

We annotated 2000 emails manually, out of which we could use 1500. The remaining 500 had parsing errors so Ignored

Annotated based on our own understanding of Geopolitics
So if some issue in say Brazil, not as important as some issue in Libya or Afghanistan

We only used 2 signals, subject and body, and ignored rest as it would complicate our training

We had skewed categories of emails, more spammy and congratulatory, and less serious nature, as those may be discussed on IMs, WhatsApp etc.


=======

Slide #12 - Future Work

Something we hope to work in future like

Remove data limitations

Implement user feedback system

Directly train and personlize model

Federated learning

Support other email providers like Microsoft etc.
