SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an intemet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddaft family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the ""Jimmy Carter Strategy"": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By cY'aia?,_
(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had intel"" about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, ""and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.""
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board —
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board —
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (jCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet . The President came away from this

discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil
Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.

6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than loo
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
All Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.
8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security
situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.
Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia
forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to
Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government
can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian
goverment is stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on
the security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following
the death of the U.S. Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end
the power of the regional militia forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President
knows that foreign companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not
increase their commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their
personnel and facilities. In a'final note, this individual added that the Italian government is
stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other
Italian firms.)

Issa targets Hillary: Big mistake
By Brent Budowsky - 10/10/12 04:03 PM ET
Don't miss the story in The Hill ""Issa closes in on Clinton"" about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his
biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will
prove to be a disaster. House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge
mistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the
most admired and respected public servants in the nation.
There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan
witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing
days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe
has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many
voters.
Many independent voters will be offended. Many female voters will be offended. Many voters tired of their
taxpayer money being wasted for political shenanigans will be offended.

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's Apri123 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as ""good people,"" but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa`ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems

or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)
In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first stop In this campaign was the April X) bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.
The INC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Salt al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Herb°Mk While the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the loaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These INC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muamrnar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources. the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the INC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a
new government. Under the plan Muatnmar Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qaddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the
rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Sail al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

(Source Comment: These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the INC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the
TNC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

147,"<b>Subject:</b> <i>JEFF UPDATE</i><br/><b>Body</b>:<pre class='summary'>Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our
representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to
discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on
South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa
problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making
Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out
attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the
UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way
of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the
U.S. interagency process.
My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.
I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril
again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role
approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I
need to join Chris here in the coming days.
Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all
the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in
establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team. Thanks to a lot of creativity and hard work, the

Subject: Jeff update
Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our
representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to

Subject: Video shows Libyans helping rescue US ambassador after attack (Reuters)
BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.
The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.
The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.
The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
floor.
""There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out,"" said one man, shouting for
help.
""Bring him out, man! Bring him out,"" another said.
""The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out,"" said a third.
""Alive, Alive! God is Greatest,"" the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.
""Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?"" another man can
be heard saying.
Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
insulted the Prophet Mohammad.
Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
and gunfire that ensued.
The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and

Some Libyan officials blamed the attack on radical Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda, such as regional
affiliate Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Ansar al-Sharia. Both groups back the introduction of Islamic
Sharia law rather than democracy.
The footage shows Stevens lying on the floor in a smoke-filled room after protesters had stormed the
compound and set fire to its buildings.
Minutes later he was pulled out of the room through a window, and then placed on the courtyard's stone tile
floor. A young man is seen putting his hand on his neck to check if he was breathing.
A protester wearing a white T-shirt who had carried Stevens out of the room was hugged by a fellow
protestor in a traditional expression of gratitude.
Seconds after the protesters found Stevens was alive, a young man in the background can be heard shouting:
""Take him to my car, bring him to my car.""
A doctor on duty in the emergency room at the Benghazi Medical Centre that night has said local civilians
brought in the ambassador at around 1 a.m. While the doctor performed CPR for 45 minutes, Stevens died of
asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation. His body was later returned to U.S. custody.

Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Afi Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been ""no bloodbath"" or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhaii regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). Ile said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend.""
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain.""
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means ""Supporters of Shariah Law.""
""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. ""This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah.""

""If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?"" he said. ""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over

One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.""
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.""

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is ""shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said ""this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate.""
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. ""Boots on the ground"": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Hi Philippe:
Thanks very much for the note. I appreciate it.
I have deep sympathy for what your team and the families of the victims are going through. In Baghdad years
ago, someone I cared for very deeply lost her life with three others in the service of promoting our values
overseas. This experience probably added to the intensity behind my questions and responses as well.
In the interest of diplomacy and extending an olive branch: we should get a drink sometime, off the record.
Best,

As you can imagine this has been an intense time for everyone at the State Department, including me.
While I stand by the fundamental principles at issue here, that does not justify my unprofessional response to

I apologize, both for my language and for my tone.

Cheryl —
This is a quick note to say that the hearings on Benghazi are going fine, from my perspective. Pat Kennedy has been
terrific substantive, precise, and firm in the face of some outlandish behavior. We continue to fend off questions
about the unclass talking points. And I think the
time line narrative is helpful.
I will call to give you a more complete read-out

Sen. John McCain renewed his attacks on U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on Tuesday, but he's gone soft on
Hillary.
As she wraps up her tenure at Foggy Bottom and mulls over a possible 2016 White House bid, Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton's decade-old bipartisan friendship with McCain appears to have helped shield her from
GOP fire — even as her agency finds itself in the thick of a partisan battle over Benghazi.
But McCain and Clinton also are battle-tested veterans of Washington who have seen their families become
targets of nasty political attacks — and who have often turned to laughter to get through it all. For Clinton, it
was Monica Ii ewinsky; for McCain it was the smear campaign during the 2000 GOP primary aimed at his
Bangladesh-born adopted daughter.
""I think it was the best version of strange bedfellows and at the same time a perfect match,"" Tmnera Luzzatto,
Clinton's Senate chief of staff from 2001 to 2009, said of her former boss's relationship with McCain. ""They
share a sense of public service but also a sense of humor.""
McCain, a leading voice on defense and foreign policy matters, has spent weeks belittling Rice as ""not very
bright,"" incompetent and not qualified"" to succeed Clinton as secretary of state. Rice s offense: incorrectly
characterizing the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as sparked by spontaneous protests rather than as a
deliberate act of terrorism --- a lapse she has blamed on administration talking points that were approved by
intelligence officials.
But the Arizona Republican has largely spared Clinton from any criticism over the Sept. 11 Benghazi assault
that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. When Clinton tried to fall on her sword,
saying she alone was responsible for diplomatic security, McCain wouldn't have it He called Clinton's act
""laudable"" but was adamant that the buck stops with President Barack Obama and that he would try to block
Rice's possible nomination as the nation's top diplomat.
While McCain seemed to dial back his attacks on Rice over the weekend, the senator was at it again Tuesday
after he and fellow GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire sat
down with Rice at the Capitol to quiz her about why the Obarna administration mischaracterized the attack as
other than terrorism.
""We are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got and some that we didn't get,"" McCain told
reporters after the meeting. ""It is clear the information that she gave the American people was incorrect.""

Asked pointedly why he hasn't been as critical of Clinton, McCain did not directly mention the secretary, who
has decided against staying on for a second term.
""I've said it continuously that the State Department has responsibility,"" McCain told POLITICO. ""I have been
very critical of the State Department and their actions. I've been critical of everybody's actions.""
It wasn't the first time this year that McCain came to the former New York senator's defense. In July, McCain
took to the Senate floor and denounced Rep. Michele Bachmann and four other House Republicans for alleging
that longtime Clinton aide Hurna Abedin was working with the Muslim Brotherhood to infiltrate the top rungs
of the U.S. government.
The allegations, McCain said in his speech, amount to an ""unwarranted and unfounded attack on an honorable
woman, a dedicated American and a loyal public servant?'
The gratitude from the Clinton camp that day was palpable,
""We were all so very moved when Sen. McCain took to the Senate floor that day. It was nothing short of
remarkable,"" said Clinton's longtime spokesman, Philippe Reines. But after being around him all those years
in the Senate and since, and seeing firsthand his fondness and respect for Huma, it was not surprising at all
""And when someone of Sen. McCain's stature stood up for her,"" he said, really gives people pause before
trafficking in vicious and disgusting lies.""
McCain first met Clinton when she was first lady and got to know her better as he worked with her husband in
the mid-1990s on normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, where the former Navy pilot endured 5V2
years as a prison of war after his plane was shot down. The daughter of a World War II Navy officer herself,
Clinton admired McCain's military service, and the two spent countless hours together at markups and hearings
of the Senate Armed Services Committee after the Sept. Ii, 2001, attacks.
""Like her husband, she really studies the issues, she is a policy wonk, and I mean that in a complimentary
fashion,"" McCain told POLITICO on Tuesday. ""She puts people at ease, she is a role model to a lot of young
women in America -- my daughter [Meghan] admires her a great deal.

""Some people you hit it off with, some people not so much. She and I seemed to hit it off with each other and
enjoy each other's company.""
Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) has traveled extensively with
McCain and Clinton and watched their relationship grow.
""To put it mildly, they don't always agree. John and I have been pestering and pressuring the administration,
including the secretary, on current matters like Syria, that we're not doing enough in Syria,"" Lieberman told
POLITICO. ""But there is a strong, mutually respectful, personal relationship, and it's quite cordial.
""When we're all together, we not only talk seriously — we laugh a lot.""
In 2008, McCain and Clinton were almost presidential rivals — if not for a young, charismatic upstart named
Barack Obama. Four years earlier, the two senators found themselves side by side on a small cruise ship in the
Arctic Circle, bundled up in jackets and ball caps and gazing at the ""midnight sun"" in Svalbard.
Invited by the Norwegian government, Clinton and McCain flew to the remote archipelago — famous for its 24
hours of continuous sunlight — to see firsthand the effects of climate change on the melting ice cap.
It was ""a shared experience being in a place where we sat outside and watched the sun go down and just touch
the horizon and then go back up,"" McCain recalled.
Svalbard would be the first of many trips abroad together for the future secretary of state and 2008 GOP
standard-bearer: During a 2006 visit to Estonia, Clinton reportedly challenged McCain to a vodka-drinking
contest, the two have frequently met up at the annual Munich Security Conference, and they've dropped into
military hot spots like Iraq.
""They are two people I would invite to a party,"" said Graham, another frequent traveling companion.
But as Clinton exits the world stage — albeit perhaps temporarily — Graham and other Republicans are
signaling she may not escape the Benghazi debacle entirely unscathed.

House again.""

HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna
administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.
This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much
more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He
sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for
intervention, not just say it's too hard to do.
The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this
case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American
power, not merely American politics.

HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

The Benghazi protestors appear to
be a pastiche of different groups of disaffected people including war-wounded, martyrs' families, transparency and
accountability demendeurs, and those who believe the east is once again being neglected. So the source of this report
attributing the whole thing to war-wounded does not jive, although they may have been the ones who carried out
the violent acts. The Belhaj bogeyman is a bit overplayed-no doubt his military influence has waned but he does remain
a player —one of many —looking to make political gain in this new environment The proposition that he is just lying in
waiting to take advantage of the current stability to move in and establish an Islamic state appears a bit
exaggerated. Minister of Labor Rajbani (who has his own axes to grind) said there is now a group of six ministers (I need
to clarify whether this is with al-Keeb's knowelcige or not) who are serving as the ""cohones"" of the cabinet and taking
decisions the others won't al-Keeb Is proceding cautiously (that is his strength and weakness) and that is the problem-
this is really the time for a ""war-time"" cabinet not the cautious approach he appears to be taking does not suit this volatile
time Let's see what the meeting today between the NTC and the government produces—the benghazi protests, the Bani
Walid conflict and the various other incidents that have flared up in recent days point to the need for some real drastic
movement in the DDR process and in the other issues that engender current dissatisfaction among the populace. I can
really comment on the points regarding foreign contracts except to say it rings true given the current governments
reluctance to make any significant decisions, especially regarding past or future issues of money. The Hefter piece also
sounds a bridge too far given al-Keeb's disposition. But I do agree that it is not too late if this government can just
organize itself and take some fundamental decisions to i mprove liquidity, get the real war-wounded good treatment and
push the MOD and MOI to speed up the DDR process.

1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul „late spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point, with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and

a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011, Jaill also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jan!, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd All to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifs Belqasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3. (Source Comment In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the Inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that JalIl is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel — Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with Belhaj as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Haftar, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalil will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WASHINGTON
Dear Colleagues —
I wanted to reach out to you directly after this challenging week, and express my gratitude for everything you
do to advance our nation's interests and values. That is how we keep faith with those we serve and honor
those we've lost. Even after four years, I continue to be amazed by your dedication, energy, and talent. It is a
privilege to be part of your team.
I also want to thank everyone who is working so hard to provide all our people and posts with the best
possible leadership, security and support. As Deputy Secretaries Burns and Nides told Congress on Thursday,
our colleagues in Diplomatic Security, Near Eastern Affairs, and in every bureau across the Department, at
home and abroad, get it right countless times a day, for years on end, in some of the toughest circumstances
imaginable. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi, and make every possible improvement -- and we
will. We also need to recognize the extraordinary service of our security professionals. They are courageous
patriots and consummate professionals. And like you, I trust them with my life.
I want to thank Ambassador Pickering, Admiral Mullen, and all the members of the Accountability Review
Board. Their report takes a clear-eyed look at serious and systemic problems that we are already working to
fix. I have accepted every one of the Board's recommendations. I asked the Deputy Secretary for
Management and Resources to spearhead the effort to implement them, and to take those additional steps
above and beyond those recommendations that make sense and make us stronger. To do this well, we need
your help. All of us have to work together to take these reforms to heart and build on and improve the way
we do business.
I am determined to leave the State Department and USAID stronger, safer, and more secure than I found
them. I owe that to each of you. And I am delighted that President Obama has chosen Senator John Kerry to
continue that work. Earlier today, I spoke with John and congratulated him on his nomination to be the next
Secretary of State. I have been privileged to know him for many years, and to call him a friend, colleague, and
partner. He is the son of a career Foreign Service Officer, a decorated war hero, and an accomplished
statesman. I know that he shares our deep commitment to diplomacy and development. You deserve the
highest caliber leadership, and that is exactly what you'll get with Senator Kerry.

the LMB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be
ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will
continue to up the ante with Tripoli, including possibly making a move on the oil production in that part of the country

Below is the latest report from HRC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abclel Jalil stated in very direct terms
that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
the Federalist movement for the semi autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic).
Minister of Defense Ousarra al Juwali and Prime Minister Abdurrahirn el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement fl
Eastern Libya.

According to al Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
fear that the Federalist movement in Barqa will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that if matters are not resolved by the
July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
reactivate existing agreements.
2.
According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
their regime.
Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
(JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support In the event military force is needed to hold
the country together.
Belhaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
3.
According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.
4. (Source Comment:
In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
concerns of the international business community.
The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
5.
According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
Badie and his advisors for support.
This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
Badie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
levels of violence.
6.
(Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
develop a plan to deal with the LMB.

According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
revolution in 2011.
Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
wash over into Egypt.)
7.
According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with SW al-Islam Qaddafi, whose
goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
8.
According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
2011 revolution.
However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kltef was a leading figure in
the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu SeIlm. Under Abu Kitef and
leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
established itself as a unique group within the Jai Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
9.
In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a
political party; the JCP.
Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB
leader Soliman Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
LMB.
10.(Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc, including
the LMB/JCP

Jake - Thanks for this. Tracks with what we are hearing about elections and the weakness of the interim govt. Elections
are going smoothly throughout most of Libya (Ajdabiya being the exception, where some ballots were sabotaged
requiring voting in some centers to be postponed for a few hours). Factoring in time to tally votes and process appeals,
the UN and the Libyan elections commission are anticipating announcing final results by late July. The expectation is
that the TNC will remain in power until the new congress is seated.
Sett McCain and I toured the new parliament this afternoon, where we encountered a TNC member, an engineer and a
couple of UN experts reviewing progress on the interior decor of the main chamber. They are racing to get the chamber
finished in time for the first session. The UN is offering technical assistance to the secretariat of the new congress,
ranging from parliamentary procedure to legislative drafting. They're even helping to plot out the choreography of the
first sessions.
The atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive. The gov't declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and
waving flags and making peace sign gestures. We visited several polling stations where we found people patiently
waiting in lines (gender segregated) lvlcCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.

SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel ialil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to extend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200 member General National Congress (6 NC) Jail) realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
Jaill expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.

2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Made!
Rahrnan el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC — was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jai continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jalil now realizes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jail' has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country. In particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebu tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sine, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.
6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, JAI and Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (CNC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

E-diplomacy? Hillary Clinton Embraces New Media By MATTHEW LEE AP Sat, Mar 21, 2009
WASHINGTON (AP) — Her videos aren't quite viral yet and she's not tweeting, but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton is embracing new media, using the Web to promote the agency and her role as the nation's top envoy.
In less than three months, Clinton's State Department has embarked on a digital diplomacy drive aimed at spreading the
word about American foreign policy and restoring Washington's image. Part of a broader Internet outreach by President
Barack Obama's administration, Clinton's Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors.
Since taking over at Foggy Bottom, Clinton's team has built on e-diplomacy innovations developed during George W.
Bush's presidency:
- They have revamped the department's Web site (http://www.state.gov) and the Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.gov
and http://twitter.com/dipnote) with a fresh array of features, graphics and colorful posts.
- Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5)
- They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube
(http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo).
- They can pose questions through an ""ask-the-secretary"" column
(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) that recently was revised to ""text the secretary.""
(http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm)
""New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy, where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential to
achieving our foreign policy goals,"" said Cheryl Mills, Clinton's longtime confidante and chief of staff.
Even for a government Web site, early indications show a surge in interest, according to internal State Department
statistics provided to The Associated Press.
Daily views of the Dipnote have doubled from 10,000 a year ago to 20,000 today, with 700 subscribers to its RSS feed,
twice as many as in March 2008. The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan. 20, when
Obama took office, while the department's Facebook friends have increased by 2 1/2 times in the same period.
8
""What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment,"" said Peter Daou, who was Clinton's Web guru during her
2008 presidential run. ""They are starting to push the envelope.""
What remains unclear, though, is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public's fascination
with Clinton's latest career shift.
""The personality behind it can't be dismissed,"" said Daou, who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U.N.
Dispatch (http://www.undispatch.com).
Like Obama, Clinton carries a Blackberry, but she is not allowed to use it on the department's secure seventh floor
where her office is. Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web, responding to bloggers and
pushing her agency's new media agenda.
""The United States Government is behind nearly everybody, except in certain discrete areas, in terms of technology,""
she told department employees at a town hall meeting in February. ""We are, in my view, wasting time, wasting money,
wasting opportunities, because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the business
world and the private world.""
Clinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign. She announced her entry into the
race in February 2007 on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals.
Nonetheless, Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaign's mastery of the Internet and social networking sites.
Obama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers.
Clinton was first lady when the first White House Web site debuted in 1994. It was a bare-bones operation compared
with what is available now. Three years later, the State Department went online during Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's tenure.
But it wasn't until 2007, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's spokesman, Sean McCormack, that the
department's public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest. McCormack started the Dipnote blog, which
some foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy.
The site endured under Rice. Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts from
diplomats.
It's more than just window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter to ""tweet"" down false rumors they feared
might lead to a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Madagascar.
On her first two foreign trips, to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe, local bloggers were ""embedded"" with the
traveling press corps, broadening the audience for Clinton's official meetings and public appearances, which often
produce more personal than policy questions.
On her question site, Clinton has responded to a varied questions, from ""Should the U.S. engage in direct dialogue with
Hamas?"" to ""How did you like meeting the Japanese students?""
By the end of Clinton's trip to the Mideast, her ""text the secretary"" feature had received nearly 2,000 text messages. On
both trips, Clinton also participated in Webcasts. One in Beijing on climate change generated more than 10.2 million
page views, more than 50,000 comments and 7,000 questions, according to the statistics.
Clinton's staff say they plan to venture further into the realm of social networking, an animated online world called
Second Life, and cell phone technology. The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized
9
project that brought together Facebook, Google, Howcast, YouTube, AT&T, MTV, Columbia Law School, Access360Media
and Gen-Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit.
It also wants to expand on X-Life, a mobile phone game launched in February that is aimed at helping youth in the
Middle East learn English and teaching them about American history, culture and values.

Poll: Clinton has high job approval
http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/25/clinton.poll/
(CNN) -- As Hillary Clinton flies to Mexico for a high-level summit, a new national poll indicates seven in 10 Americans are happy with
the job she's doing as secretary of state.
Seventy-one percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday said they approve of how
Clinton is handling her job as America's top diplomat. Fewer than one in four disapprove.
""Nine in 10 Democrats approve of Clinton -- that's no surprise,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""But by a 50 percent to 43
percent margin, Republicans also think she is doing a good job at the State Department. That's an interesting result for a polarizing
figure like Clinton.""
The poll's release comes as Clinton teams up with Mexican officials to kick off weeks of meetings intended to find ways to fight drug
violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a major increase in security
funding and agent deployments along the border. '--

""Since taking office in January, Clinton has been at the White House nearly every day, meeting with President Obama, Vice President
[Joseph] Biden and other members of the Cabinet and national security staff,"" said CNN State Department producer Elise Labott. ""The
secretary maintains close ties with her former colleagues on Capitol Hill and meets regularly with congressional leaders.""
The former first lady, senator from New York and one-time primary rival to Obama already has clocked close to 60,000 miles in her first
two trips overseas -- one journey to China, the other to the Middle East and Europe -- since becoming secretary of state in January.
Clinton was met by large crowds and warmly received by world leaders on both trips, although ""she met some criticism in Beijing, where
she was criticized for a lower-key approach that seemed to downplay the importance of human rights in the overall relationship with
China,"" Labott said.
""Her aides said she wanted a new approach to dealing with China's human rights record, including less public criticism and more
private discussions, which may prove more productive in changing Chinese behavior.""
Clinton's approval rating is higher than that of her boss: The same CNN/Opinion Research poll put Obama's approval rating at 64
percent, 7 percentage points lower than Clinton's.
Clinton has a couple of advantages over Obama in public opinion today, Holland said.

""She hasn't had a prominent role in the administration's economic or budget policies,"" he said. ""There haven't been any international
issues that have caused as much outrage as the AIG bonuses. And her name wasn't on the ballot in November, so any partisan
animosity to her that is left over from 2008 is not as fresh in the public's mind.""
Clinton's approval rating is also 10 percentage points higher than the one her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, had in March 2005, then
two months into her tenure as secretary of state.
The CNN/Opinion Research poll of 1,019 Americans was conducted by telephone March 12-15. The survey's sampling error is plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

Gov R called back. I gave him a general brief on the launch and we discussed the call last night from KMG re a possible
trip. Gov R said that he would continue to ""stay under the radar"" on the matter, ""despite many interview requests."" He
added that he has been talking to Lisa Ling of the View and urging her to also stay low-profile, although he said she may
feel that she has to speak out soon. He agreed to keep in touch with us over the next few days.

read your Princeton speech which the article referenced.
In addition, I'd welcome your ideas about how best to identify and promote the next generation of ""Bill Burns

That is one of my reform goals.
On another matter, we are in good shape at the UN on the DPRK Pres. Statement

Holbrooke would like to attend the Kazakhstan bilat. Bill Burns will attend, as will the ambassador and

Burns also attended) so I wanted to check with you to see if you had views on this.

EUR tells me that they have engaged fully with Ambassador Bagley and Kris Balderston on this project, and that
Ambassador Bagley has spoken with the Italian Ambassador and reviewed the proposed approach. She said he thought
that it sounded like a good plan and would be warmly received. They are ready to convene a meeting with the NIAF
President as soon as the Secretary approves the action memo.

Subject: For the Secretary of State visit to Haiti
I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary
of State and former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a
brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to Haiti:
We discussed the catalytic role the United States could play in leveraging much needed private
investment in large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my
report I pointed out that the port in Port-au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean
and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports remain a critical bottleneck to a job
creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a pivotal role in
ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction
projects can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely
manner. Elsewhere I have argued that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that
available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and
stand ready to do more. In fact, Prime Minister Pierre-Louis noted in the letter to investors which
was presented at the meeting with Charles Rangel and garment entrepreneurs on Monday, that
""ISPS certification of port facilities and alleviation of customs procedures"" are in progress. The
meetings tomorrow may present an opportunity to emphasize once again how central well-
functioning, competitive ports are to attract foreign investors as part of the HOPEII window and
to put the right transport infrastructure in place.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
""We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable,"" Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is ""a signal that there can be"" a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are ""baseless.""
The North has previously said they would go on trial for ""hostile acts"" and illegally entering the country. Their trial would
be held ""on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them,"" it has announced.
While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along
the narrow Tumen River which marks the border with China.

Subject: second conversation with Mr. Gore re detained Amcits in North Korea
I spoke with Mr. Gore a second time today; I called him this afternoon after we had seen some brief wire stories appear,
referencing the KCNA report below. Explaining that this was my personal view, I said I was encouraged that the term
""espionage"" did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were ""indicted"" and ""brought to trial."" I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as ""illegal entry"" and ""suspected hostile acts""; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.
Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to
the family members. I told him we would do so through CA.

Draft Letter Signals Clinton Ready For
Equal Treatment at State
By Kerry Eleveld
The Advocate has obtained a draft of a letter from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to employees of the State Department
that details her intentions to extend certain benefits to same-sex partners of foreign service officers posted abroad.
""Historically, domestic partners of Foreign Service members have not been provided the same training, benefits, allowances,
and protections that other family members receive. These inequities are unfair and must end. Providing training, medical
care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and effectiveness of our Posts abroad,"" says
the letter.
The letter explains that the department will be ""exercising its inherent authority to change its regulations in the Foreign
Affairs Manual and Department of State Standardized Regulations"" in order to allow domestic partners of foreign service
personnel to qualify as family members. ""Where appropriate, this extension of benefits and allowances will apply to the
children of domestic partners as well.""
Providing these benefits to all employees, notes the letter, will help the department ""attract and retain personnel in a
competitive environment where domestic partner benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class
employers. At bottom, the Department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners
because it is the right thing to do.""
The letter appears to be the culmination of Secretary Clinton's work with LGBT employee groups at the State Department. A
source familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the letter was drafted by senior officials at
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761559 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761559 Date: 06/30/2015
the department and represents the Secretary's thinking on the issue. The letter currently awaits final approval from senior
government lawyers.
The draft is consistent with statements made this week by California Congressman Howard Berman that Secretary Clinton
is committed to equalizing the treatment of gay employees of the State Department and that he anticipated an
announcement on the matter soon.
Full text of the letter is below:
DRAFT INTERNAL RELEASE
For Review
Today, I am pleased to announce that the Department of State will be extending a number of benefits and allowances to
domestic partners of members of the Foreign Service assigned abroad.
While a career in the Foreign Service is rewarding, the demands to serve our country both at home and abroad also require
great sacrifice by our Foreign Service personnel and their families as well. Family members often must uproot their lives,
endure hardship conditions, and put their own careers on hold. Like all families, our Foreign Service families come in
different configurations; all are part of the common fabric of our Post communities abroad.
Historically, domestic partners of Foreign Service members have not been provided the same training, benefits, allowances,
and protections that other family members receive. These inequities are unfair and must end. Providing training, medical
care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and effectiveness of our Posts abroad. It will
also help the Department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner benefits and
allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers. At bottom, the Department will provide these benefits for
both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because it is the right thing to do.
The Department will be exercising its inherent authority to change its regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual and
Department of State Standardized Regulations to allow the domestic partners of Department Foreign Service personnel to
qualify as family members for a variety of benefits and allowances. Where appropriate, this extension of benefits and
allowances will apply to the children of domestic partners as well. To qualify for these benefits and allowances, an employee
must file an affidavit identifying his or her domestic partner and certifying to certain eligibility requirements that will be set
forth in the FAM.
The Department of State intends to provide the following additional benefits and allowances for declared domestic partners of
eligible employees serving overseas:
Diplomatic passports,
Inclusion on employee travel orders to and from posts abroad,
Shipment of household effects,
Inclusion in family size calculations for the purpose of making housing allocations,
Family member preference for employment at posts abroad,
Use of medical facilities at posts abroad,
Medical evacuation from posts abroad,
Emergency travel for the partners to visit gravely ill or injured employees,
Inclusion as family members for emergency evacuation from posts abroad,
Subsistence payments related to emergency evacuation from posts abroad,
Inclusion in calculations of payments of overseas differentials and allowances (e.g., payment for quarters, cost of
living, and other allowances),
Representation expenses, and
Training at the Foreign Service Institute.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761559 Date: 06/30/2015
The Department also will work with our inter-agency partners and host country governments to provide domestic partners
with diplomatic visas, appropriate diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities, and authorization to work in the local
economy abroad.
We look forward to implementing these changes.

Subject: Dyncorps Post Story -- Second Shoe To Drop
Folks,
You may recall an April 17 Post story on problems with Dyncorps in Afghanistan which focused on a suspected
drug overdose death, breakdown in internal controls within the company, and actions the USG and the firm
were taking. The other issue that surfaced at the time was a colossal error in judgment by one of the
contractors' employees in hiring an adolescent boy dancer for some sort of event that, at least to most folks,
looked very inappropriate. The Post is now looking at the dancing boy, which was not included in the April 17,
article, and we expect will soon publish a story on it.
The Post inquiry at this point focuses only on confirming whether or not there's an OIG investigation. We are,
of course, referring the Post to the OIG on such a question. However, the premise for the question raises the
issue again in some eye-popping rhetoric which could feature in the follow-up story, so I wanted to make sure
everyone had a heads-up.
We have already relieved the folks involved with both incidents and I am meeting with the firm's CEO today to
hear his report on his trip to Afghanistan and Iraq to address these, as well as other, issues on which we have
demanded corrective actions.
I'm attaching the original note to Deputy Secretary Lew at the time of the original inquiry which lays out both
issues, a copy of the memo the INL section at Embassy Kabul provided to Post Management on the most
recent Post inquiry, as well as the Post inquiry itself for context.
David.
Incoming from Post:
""According to my reporting, the week of April 13th, the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers,
allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site.
Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This
was captured on video. The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy's waistband, just as they would
a stripper's garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes.

No sex took place.
The video was leaked to Kabul INL program manager, Marissa Martin. INL Washington ordered INL Kabul to replace the
entire DynCorp chain of commaand.
The video was leaked by Mike Gonzalez to another DynCorp employee who emailed the video to Martin. Flint Chambers
retaliated against Mike by spitting in his face, pushing him to the ground in front of the DynCorp security building in Kabul.
Chambers was fired, along with Dean Deines, Stan Knee and David Kelly.
Can you confirm that the IG is looking into this? (in addition to the Kurt Schafer incident)
Thank you,

Madam Secretary-
I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

I talked with Mary Beth Sheridan. This is actually a pretty good story. The thrust of the piece is that there is a great deal
of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America — talk of investments, projects and so forth — but so far very
little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this
context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that
It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.
On the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral. If
it turns out that is not happening, that's good news. The Iranians see themselves as the big winners in the second Gulf
War. They are trying to extend their influence, particularly in their own region, but elsewhere where they see possible
openings. But while they are trying to buy friends and influence people around the world, the results are clearly mixed.
The story will probably run Sunday.

Cheryl,
Great meeting you yesterday. I enjoyed the conversation and am looking forward very much to
working with you. The security interview went fine, I believe. I owe them some more information which
they will get over the weekend.
Separately I have attached a bio for as promised.
Talk to you soon. Thanks again,

Cheryl:
In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow, below and attached are a timeline and deliverables as we discussed
last week.
I am having a lot of fun. I'm working my tail off, which I enjoy. If demand is an indicator of performance, I think
I'm getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing
those words come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to
people and people to government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering
people across the globe. I think this can be a major part of HRC's legacy.
Anyway ... here's the requested content for your review:

Trip Report: Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Rome
Anne-Marie Slaughter
Shanghai: I was driven around the expo site and saw how far advanced the Chinese pavilion is, also the Canadian and
Brazilian pavilions that are facing and adjacent to us, and many spectacular European pavilions. In addition to the
overwhelming size and grandeur of the expo site as a whole — it will be like the New York World's Fair on steroids — what
struck me is that we must also hold up our end with the many visitors who will be coming from the Americas. The video
of the history of world expositions that plays in the Shanghai exposition building and will help open the expo itself is a
visual of rising American power — repeated expos in the 19th and 20th centuries in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San
Francisco and other American cities. Expos are the soft power Olympics and hence a key part of smart power; we should
be willing to ask Congress for money and consider it extremely well spent in terms of building American power in the
world — and cheap at the price.
I also had several meals and meetings with members of what I am coming to think of as ""the American diaspora"" —
talented and entrepreneurial Chinese-Americans and Chinese raised/educated in America who have come back to China
to live on the economic frontier — and who are spreading American values with them. They gave a very optimistic picture
of the Chinese economy.
Beijing: I had dinner with ""new media figures""
In my official meetings on the S&ED we made real progress, getting the Chinese to agree to a closed meeting just with
the four principals and getting them to agree to consider a model of a joint statement that we will now provide; I made
very clear that a joint statement was critical to getting results. Later in the day we had a breakthrough with the Deputy
Minister of Commerce, who agreed to working level meetings and concrete ""bottom-up"" joint projects on development
assistance. His staff agreed to meet w/ the AID person at our embassy for the first time — as the embassy said, clearly
the Chinese have decided to move forward w/ us on multiple fronts.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761932 Date: 06/30/2015
The most striking thing to emerge from many conversations with officials and academics in Shanghai and Beijing was
how often the G-2 was raised — always in the context of ""we don't believe in the G-2, but ..."" One official said ""we can
just take away the 'G' and leave the '2.' I was at pains to emphasize that the U.S. has no interest in a G-2,
Seoul: a conversation with faculty and the dean of the school of international studies at Ewa University revealed a
perception that ""China does not object to a nuclear-armed DPRK because that would prevent reunification permanently,
as Japan and China itself would never agree to a nuclear reunited Korea."" Talks with my Japanese and Korean
yielded dgreement 1.4(B)
The Japanese raised and the Koreans welcomed the prospect of China-U.S.-Korea talks to match the new 1.4(D)
China-U.S.-Japan talks. Both the Koreans and the Japanese raised the idea of an ""Asian G-8"" — U.S., China, Japan, Russia, gi
Korea, Australia, India, and one other .."" I raised the idea of convening the Asian members of the G-20 plus us, which
would include all those countries plus Indonesia.
Rome: I met with my G-8 counterparts over dinner and then w/ G-8 policy planners plus representatives from South
Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt. The G-8 discussion yielded strong agreement that responsibility for outcomes should be
a key determinant of who gets to sit at the table, although the Germans and Italians want to expand the core
""convening"" group to at least the G-8 plus the Heiligendamm 5. Canada, France, Britain and Japan very much liked my
tentatively floated idea that each G-8 member be able to decide as host which other countries to invite as full members,
depending on the problem chosen as the focus of the agenda. Strikingly, did not even bother to send a Rome- B1
based representative to the talks the next day, underlining my point that some of these countries really are not ready 1.4(D)
for regular responsibility for global issues. The representative, a truly impressive director general in their
DFA, said was not pushing for a G-13, as it felt uncomfortable being anointed when so many African
countries were not represented. In the substantive discussion of Af-Pak and central Asia, the mbassador to
Rome emphasized that the Rio Group was taking a political position on Af-Pak as a sign of increasing hemispheric
engagement with the outside world.

Cheryl—
In anticipation of our conversation later today, here are some thoughts in support of an appointment at State:
• I've been cleared by State Dept security for an ambassadorial-level position
• My resume (attached) shows good experience in numerous areas useful at State—and I'm known for being able
to get the job done
• I'm ready to go---right now; I can begin immediately to contribute
• No one can question my loyalty—I've had a lot of years of successfully making high ranking government officials
look good

Utah Governor to Become Ambassador to China
By Jeff Zeleny
Updated President Obama on Saturday selected one of the nation's leading Republican governors to serve as
the ambassador to China, nominating Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the diplomatic post that Mr. Obama called
""as important as any in the world.""
""We will launch a new era of partnership between our two nations that will advance our shared dreams of
opportunity and security in America, in Asia and around the world,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I can think of no more
important assignment than creating the kinds of bridges between our two countries that will determine the well
being not just of Americans and Chinese, but also the future of the world.""
In a morning announcement at the White House, Mr. Huntsman stood at the president's side in the Diplomatic
Room and accepted the position that he said came as a surprise. As a co-chairman of Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign last year, Mr. Huntsman said he did not expect to be ""called into action by the person
who beat us.""
Mr. Huntsman, 49, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese from his days as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan. He
has worked in two Bush administrations, serving as the ambassador to Singapore in the final year of George
H.W. Bush's term and as a deputy United States trade ambassador for George W. Bush.
For Mr. Obama, whose advisers already have their eyes set on his re-election in 2012, the selection of Mr.
Huntsman is something of a political coup. He has emerged as one of the nation's most visible Republican
governors and was expected to at least consider seeking his party's presidential nomination to run against Mr.
Obama.
""In the breadth of issues at stake, this ambassadorship is as important as any in the world,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I
believe there is much to be gained from a closer working relationship with China, but improved relationships
will require candor on issues in which we don't always agree.""
As the Republican Party forges through a period of reinvention, Mr. Huntsman has been a leading voice for the
direction of the party. He has been a political moderate on issues like immigration, gay rights and the
environment, even though he represented one of the most conservative states in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
It was far from certain whether Mr. Huntsman would have actually sought the Republican presidential
nomination — his centrist views could have created a challenge in early-voting states — but if he is confirmed by
the Senate for the ambassadorship to China, he is part of the Obama team at a time when China is of critical
importance. And he is out of the mix in the 2012 presidential race.
""When the president of the United States asks you to step up and serve in a capacity like this, that to me is the
end of the conversation and the beginning of the obligation to rise to the challenge,"" said Mr. Huntsman, who
was joined by his wife Mary Kaye, and the couple's seven children, one of whom was adopted from China.
The courtship of Mr. Huntsman was overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, Ralun Emanuel, who met with
him last Saturday when the governor was in town for the White House Correspondent's dinner. Mr. Obama also
spoke to Mr. Huntsman, aides said, and was impressed by his experience and views on China.
""Governor Huntsman has respect for China's proud traditions,"" Mr. Obama said Saturday. ""He understands
what it will take to make America more competitive in the 21st century and will be an unstinting advocate for
America's interests and ideals.""
The nomination of Mr. Huntsman is the latest in a series of high-level Republican appointments in the Obama
administration. The president selected two Republicans to serve in his Cabinet, but aides said he was frustrated
when a third choice, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, withdrew his nomination as
Commerce Secretary.
Mr. Huntsman, who was elected to his second term of governor last year, intends to step down if he is
confirmed by the Senate.
""I hope the good people of Utah will forgive me and understand how proud they should be of their governor for
his willingness to serve,"" Mr. Obama said. ""He always puts country ahead of himself. That's what Jon has
always done.""

Jake/Jim/Bill:
Attached and below is a draft of the international energy coordinator position. I have been speaking with David
Goldwyn regarding this position, which the Secretary has offered and he has accepted. We now are in the devil
in the details position description both to encompass the scope and authority of the role to accomplish key
objectives in international energy security but also to fulfill the mission outlined by the legislation that the
Secretary embraced in QFRs from Senator Lugar (who created this position and has been unhappy about it's
double-hatting in the past rather than a dedicated staffing).
Please review and advise of any suggested edits or revisions. My goal is to seek to get this to David in the early
afternoon. This is, as you will see, a bit of a high wire act as:

I am confident I did not capture all those goals — welcome your wisdom and guidance at your earliest
convenience — in text edits in caps most appreciated (preferred over general comments). We are pushing so that
by the Secretary's hearing on Weds, we can respond yes should he inquire if this position is in process.

• Dennis Ross, who most recently served as a special State Department envoy to Iran, will abruptly be relieved of his
duties, sources in Washington told Haaretz. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.
The Obama administration will announce that Ross has been reassigned to another position in the White House. In his
new post, the former Mideast peace envoy under President Bill Clinton will deal primarily with regional issues related to
the peace process.
Washington insiders speculate that a number of reasons moved the administration to reassign Ross. One possibility is
Iran's persistent refusal to accept Ross as a U.S. emissary given the diplomat's Jewish background as well as his
purported pro-Israel leanings. Ross is known to maintain contacts with numerous senior officials in Israel's defense
establishment and the Israeli government.

Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem surmised that another possibility for Ross' ouster is his just-released book, ""Myths,
Illusions, and Peace - Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East.""
Ross, who co-wrote the book with David Makovsky, a former journalist who is a fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, argued against a linkage between the Palestinian issue and the West's policy against Iran's nuclear
ambitions.
Ross and Mokovsky also raised the possibility of military action against Iran.
""Tougher policies - either militarily or meaningful containment - will be easier to sell internationally and domestically if
we have diplomatically tried to resolve our differences with Iran in a serious and credible fashion,"" they wrote.
Another possible reason for the reshuffle could be Ross' dissatisfaction with his present standing in the State
Department, particularly given the fact that Washington's two other envoys to the region - George Mitchell, who is
overseeing the Mideast peace process; and Richard Holbrooke, who is dealing with Pakistan and Afghanistan - wield
great influence and are featured prominently.
A diplomatic source in Jerusalem speculated that perhaps Ross preferred to work for the National Security Agency,
which answers directly to President Barack Obama, and would thus be considered a more enhanced role.
Last year, Ross was an advisor to Obama's successful presidential campaign. Before Obama's inauguration, speculation
was rampant as to which job Ross would assume in the new administration.
On February 24, 2009, he was officially appointed as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's advisor on the Persian Gulf and
special envoy to Iran.

The Settlements Facts •
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 14, 2009
Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column,
""The Settlements Myth,"" is one example.
Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the ""road map"" for peace,
which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: ""GO! [Government of Israel] immediately
dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all
settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).""
Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's
April 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security
adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing
Israeli building within the ""construction line"" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such
understanding.
The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that
construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.
The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building
only inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the
built-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of
these provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.
Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which
Israel would retain ""existing major Israeli population centers"" in the West Bank ""on the basis of mutually
agreed changes. . . ."" One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some
settlements was predicated on there being an ""agreed outcome"" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that
this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush
Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or
other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.
In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the ""construction line,"" saying that ""within the
agreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition
of the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria."" However, there never were any ""agreed principles
of settlement activities."" Moreover, the effort to define the ""construction line"" was never consummated: Israel
and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of
settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised ""continuous action"" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but
Israel removed almost none of them.
Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.
But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush
administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding
continued settlement activity.
Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the ""natural
growth"" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this ""means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the
1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies."" This is nonsense. No one
suggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to
build more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like
Americans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.
The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,
when Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.
The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural
increase of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of ""natural growth"" in official
documents started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 ""road map,"" reflecting recognition that the
concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing
policies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of
achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'
responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.
President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no"" way justify Israeli failure to
implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freeze
all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.

More Gay Donors Drop Out of DNC Fundraiser, Protesting Justice Department Brief
June 18, 2009 2:30 PM
""This is not appropriate time"" for the Democratic party to be hitting up gays and lesbians for money, says
Richard Socarides, a former Special Assistant to President Clinton, who's not attending next week's lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.
Socarides tells ABC News that many members of the LGBT community are troubled by a brief filed by
President Obama's Justice Department last week that argued. — too vociferously, many believe — against
same sex marriage.
""The brief was very troubling to a lot of people and rightfully so,"" Socarides says. ""Supporters of the
Democratic party and others who feel that gay and lesbian equality is an important issue for this administration
to address are rightly concerned about this brief. Serious issues still need clarification.""
Socarides says that even though President Obama yesterday signed a presidential memorandum extending
some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, he was also aware of what the President did not do.
""The president did not last night address what direction he would give the Justice Department when these issues
come up in the future, he did not address the continued discharges of gay people from the military.""
Socarides is just the latest in a list of prominent gay and lesbian Democrats withdrawing their
support from the DNC event. Others include David Mixner, another former adviser to President Clinton; Andy
Towle; and Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and Foundation.
And you can, as John Aravosis notes, add Vermont state senate president pro tern Peter Shumlin to the list of
prominent gay and lesbian Democrats who will not be attending.
""One thing I have learned dealing with marriage equality in Vermont is that we all have a responsibility to stand
up for the civil rights of all Americans,"" Shumlin said yesterday, according to the Times-Argus. ""This
memo from the Justice Department is more Bush than Bush. It takes the only minority group left in America
that national politicians can publicly discriminate against and still see their numbers go up in the polls and it
reinforces the horrible stereotypes about our friends and neighbors.""
And add gay Democratic donor Bruce Bastian, who told the Washington Blade he ""will continue to support
certain congressmen, congresswomen and senators whom I believe will continue to fight for our rights, but I

don't think blanket donations to the Democratic Party right now are justified, at least not in my book."" He said
he found the filing ""very offensive.""
""The administration has said they have to support the federal government's stance,"" he said. ""But in the brief,
they go way beyond where they need to go to just defend DOMA. They basically go to terminology and
language that you would expect from the Bush administration, not the Obama administration.""
Others include National Gal, and Lesbian Task Force executive director Rea Carey who decried ""the
malicious and outrageous arguments and language used in the Department of Justice's marriage brief are only
serving to inflame and malign the humanity of same-sex couples and our families,"" and the Human Rights
Campaign's national field director Marty Rouse, who told the Blade that he ""like many people, personally
offended by the words used in the [Justice Department] brief to defend DOMA. And I just can't see right now
attending a fundraiser for the DNC at this time.""

I imagine everything is quite crazy at the moment. I did not want to bother you today but would greatly appreciate it if
you would please pass along my good wishes to HRC for a fast and good recovery. Hope she will be back on track
soon. I am of course happy to help out in any way I can.
Also wanted to give you an update on ECA. Following up on our conversation over the weekend and as per your
direction I have had a number of good conversations with the ECA team including Mara. Happy to report we are all on
the same page with the career folks fully endorsing the plan. Details as follows:
• Grantee has been sanctioned
• IG is conducting investigation of grantee
• No further grants will be awarded to grantee pending outcome of IG investigation; probable outcome will be
delisting of grantee
• Working with Pat Kennedy to develop plan for spot checks of all grantees and random student checks
using existing Department resources
The IG investigation started today and as you predicted more information came out in the first meeting which led Miller
to request a full investigation of the Youth Services Program which I agreed to.
Pi did the CNN interview this a.m. No doubt it will be a tough story but according to Miller it was an honest discussion.
Have been keeping Casey's office in the loop and I plan to visit him personally. In the meantime I would like to move as
soon as possible to put someone into the A/S position on an acting basis. Do you have anyone in mind or would you like
me to make some suggestions?

Nora,
Just to close the loop, I did meet w/ Jeffrey Romoff and his team on Wed
afternoon. They gave a very impressive into on what the University
Medical Center of Pittsburgh (UPMC) is doing in Southern Italy. They are
already getting a lot of political support from our Emb in Rome and are
grateful for it.
I gave them some practical suggestions on other levers in the USG that
they could pull (TDA, OPIC, Commerce Advocacy Center).
They want the Secretary will make some positive reference to Berlusconi in
Italy this summer of their interest in working the GOI to build a
lab/production facility for developing vaccines for H1N1 and other
infectious diseases. They also note the coincidence of the G20 mtng in
Pittsburgh later this summer. I made no commitment. But I do believe this
is a genuinely positive program and our Emb agrees.
I did pass their materials to David Thorne and urged him to be in
touch. He said he would engage, once/if he is confirmed.

The Secretary is hoping you can schedule a meeting with the President of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. He is working on a project with the Italians and is seeking some guidance. I included some background below.
Please let me know if you are available for a meeting and I'll connect you with them. Thanks!
• UPMC's Relationship with Italy:
UPMC has a long and successful track record in Italy. More than a decade ago, UPMC entered into a public-
private partnership in Italy, and in collaboration with the region of Sicily and two existing
hospitals, established a major transplant and specialty care hospital. The construction of the
18
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
facility, (""ISMETT"") was funded by the government and UPMC , which oversaw the
construction and continues to manage it. It has been a great success - bringing transplantation and
specialized services to Sicily, reducing costs to the nation of ""exporting"" patients who need transplants, and as
an economic driver for the region. Based on the success of ISMETT, UPMC is now working with
the Italian government and an alliance of educational institutions to construct RIMED, a Biomedical Research
and Biotechnology Center (BRBC) outside of Palermo, which will focus on sparking a
biotechnology/regenerative medicine sector in the region. (Please see attached RiMED document.) The
government has appropriated 330 million Euros for this initiative. Further, UPMC is a consultant to the Italian
Government and is in negotiations with the regional governments in Milan and Florence. Our international
offices are in Rome.
• UPMC's Relationship with Prime Minister Berlusconi:
(a.) UPMC has had a long term and stable relationship in Italy over the past ten years, including two
governments led by Prime Minister Berlusconi. He is knowledgeable about UPMC, as is Giarmi Letta, Italian
Council of Ministry Under Secretary.
(b.) The RiMED initiative was conceived during his previous term of office and in 2005, the letter of intent for
RiMED was personally signed by Prime Minister Berlusconi and Mr. Jeffrey A. Romoff, President of UPMC.
(c.) It was under the Berlusconi administration that the decision was made to fund RiMED and 330 million
Euros were appropriated for this purpose. Mr. Romoff participated in a press conference at Palazzo Chigi
with the Prime Minister.
(d.) Recently, because of the devastating earthquake and the economic downturn, the resources to fund
RiMED have become constrained, but it is felt this is simply an issue of an unexpected contingency, rather than
any lack of interest and support.
(e.) Mr. Romoff has met with Prime Minister Berlusconi several times and is fluent in Italian.
(f .) Many of the significant political figures in Sicily are very closely associated with the Prime Minister and
his party and the importance of UPMC to the Region and potentially to Italy is reinforced.
• UPMC's Proposed 21CB:
We are pursuing funding for a flexible, multi-product biologics facility in Southwestern PA, to develop and
manufacture vaccines and therapeutic drugs as a defense against our nation's gravest threat: the Pandemic
spread of diseases and diseases used by bioterrorists as weapons of mass destruction. Thanks
to the tremendous help from our partners, Governor Rendell and Senator Arlen Specter, we have garnered
wide spread support from many across the executive Branch and Congress including Vice President Biden and
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. We will have the opportunity to brief DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano on
June 15th. The economic impact to the region would be unparalleled, resulting in approximately 1000 direct
jobs and up to 6000 indirect jobs, all the while reducing production costs to the U. S. Government by 80
%. (Please see attached 21st Century Biodefense document.)
• UPMC's Proposal for the Italian Government:
10
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
Prime Minister Berlusconi is very much tied to the American agenda and would likely be interested in
developing and funding a companion vaccine manufacturing facility- (600 million Euros,) under UPMC
management, which would serve not only to enhance the strategic defense relationship between Italy and the
United States, but also demonstrate that the Prime Minister is responsive to the increasing public concern
regarding H1N1. It can be an economic driver to both countries, as well. Italy has close ties in the
Mediterranean basin and northern Africa, in particular, and producing vaccines for these countries is desirable
in keeping with the newUS. Global Health Care Initiative. Thus, for both substantive and strategic/political
reasons, the 21CB vaccine facility should be exceedingly attractive to Italy.
As importantly, the economic gains for UPMC and the western region of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) are
very significant. As the largest employer in western Pa. , the Region depends on UPMC's
economic vitality. Excess revenue (profits) gained from exporting the intellectual and managerial capital
cultivated and developed in Pittsburgh to Italy and abroad, serve to create jobs and growth at home. Given
the unique expertise of UPMC and the international focus on health care reform, this is potentially a multi-
billion dollar export industry bring both funds and prestige to the United States.

As I told Jake and PJ, I was bit surprised that CNN (Charley Keyes) asked me at the podium if the Dept. was
concerned that the VP was seeming to be on the ascendent in foreign policy.
I talked to him off the record, and he admitted that he gets a ""steady drumbeat"" of requests from producers to find out ""if
Hillary is holding her own"" in the intragency battles, and particularly if there's infighting between her and White House.
He said what specifically prompted his q at the briefing on whether the VP was beginning to usurp S's role in foreign policy
was Gibb's announcement Tuesday that the VP was taking lead in Iraq policy (below).
I emphasized to him that the Sec is very engaged and involved in Iraq policy, noting she was on a conference call today

GIBBS: I think the meetings that I've been in, in different

Does it mean briefing? Does it mean doing some of the things he's

GIBBS: My sense is, it probably means many of those things.
Again, I think what we want to ensure happens is that, as we reach
these milestones and these important dates, that we not forget that
work has to be done to get our troops back and to achieve that
political reconciliation. This is somebody who can oversee that at
the White House and ensure that we're making continued progress toward

Tauscher Wins Plaudits From Panel, But Still Faces Hold
By Caitlin Webber, CQ Staff
California Democratic Rep. Ellen 0. Tauscher enjoyed an enthusiastic reception from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Tuesday, but a senior Republican said she'll be blocked from quick floor
consideration.
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he plans to place a hold on the Tauscher nomination as soon as it
is reported out of the committee, as leverage to get information and assurances from the Obama administration
on issues including — but not limited to — nuclear reduction talks with Russia and the deployment of ballistic
missile defense.
""All I'm going to ask for is for the administration to abide by commitments that it has made, which one would
think it could easily do,"" said Kyl. He declined to reveal the specifics of the assurances he is seeking.
As the White House's top arms control adviser, Tauscher would be charged with pushing for ratification of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a follow-on to the expiring Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START) with Russia.
Tauscher, chairwoman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, would have to contend
with considerable push-back from Senate Republicans to implement either treaty.
Many treaty opponents argue the test-ban could undermine the U.S. capacity to deter other nations from using
nuclear weapons.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762567 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762567 Date: 06/30/2015
She said Tuesday that numerous advances have been made in test-ban verification procedures and ensuring the
safety of the U.S. stockpile since the Senate rejected ratification of the CTBT nearly 10 years ago.
""Stopping nuclear proliferation by protecting our stockpile, maintaining the credibility of our deterrent and
preventing terrorists from getting a hold of a weapon of mass destruction has become my life's work,"" she told
the panel Tuesday.
She also said she would back President Obama's diplomatic efforts to persuade the eight other non-signatories
— China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Egypt — to ratify the treaty. Indonesia's
foreign minister said Monday it would ratify the CTBT, which bans all nuclear explosions for any purpose,
immediately after the United States does.
Tauscher would need to tackle critics among Senate Republicans who contend the Obama administration is
rushing into an agreement on nuclear arms reduction with Russia.
At an Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearing last week, Sens. David Vitter, R-La., and Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., said it was imprudent for the Obama administration to agree to reduced nuclear warhead
levels with Russia before the release of the Defense Department's Nuclear Posture Review, which sets the
course of the nation's nuclear stockpile, in early 2010. Administration negotiators aim to have a renewed
agreement with Russia before the current treaty expires on Dec. 5.
Tauscher told the Senate Foreign Relations panel Tuesday that she would work to allay those concerns. ""We
can multi-task. . . . I'm confident we can assure everyone . . . that what is going on in the review is informing
the negotiations.""
Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., said he would move Tauscher's nomination quickly through the committee and
would urge the full Senate to follow quickly thereafter.
Josh Rogin contributed to this story.

I just got off the phone with President Fernandez. His efforts to dissuade Zelaya and Company from traveling tomorrow
have not been successful. He was very worried about what would happen, and requested our help in ensuring that no
incidents take place at the airport.
I told him I shared his concern. I summarized for him our efforts to date, and told him that nascent engagement with
the armed forces and the de facto government would collapse if Zelaya tried to force the issue tomorrow. I told him of
the Cardinal's plea to Zelaya to not return. He said the Cardinal in Santo Domingo is close to the Honduran Cardinal, and
said he would reach out to him. I encouraged this. I told him that I thought the elements of a deal were on the table,
we just needed to find a way to get everyone to sit at the table and start talking. I told President Fernandez that he
could play an important role in creating a climate of confidence, and suggested that he reach out to interested parties
like Ricardo Maduro and others inside of Honduras. He said he would do so and get back to me

Can National Security Adviser James Jones Survive
a Second Round of Attacks and ""Longer Knives""?
I am here in London where I'm participating in an interesting forum sponsored by the Princeton Project on
National Security and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, I've received not just
one email -- but three -- from prominent insider journalists and policy hands that Jim Jones' tenure as National
Security Adviser is highly fragile.
One of these emails reports starkly:
Knives getting longer
That's all my contact said. But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his role
and responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated,
hardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members that
stayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.
I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast as
they can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously
pursue.
James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and
decision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch
retired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His
°critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a White
House on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.
Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is
managing his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is
deeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio,
the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivate
relationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.
Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the ""whack-a-mole"" crisis reaction style
of decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national
security affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to
day management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.
Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, what
the structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He
looks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to Jim Jones, the
President's effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level.
Jones' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers for
leadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing
complexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-making
process will require the attention of someone serious.
So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.
But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.
Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones' management style -- but they very
well could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have
more than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.
Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes to
Middle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration's
foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.
I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those ""longer knives"", on
the whole, do not have pure motives.

Washington Post's ""Reliable Source"" is reporting that Patti Solis Doyle has signed a book deal with Hyperion,
with an anticipated publish date of 2011.
This Just In . . .
• Patti Solis Doyle: You've managed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, been sacked via e-mail, then
resurfaced in the transition office of then-President-elect Obama. What's your next act? Book deal! She's inked it
with Hyperion for an undisclosed amount. Scheduled for 2011, the nonfiction book will trace her political journey --
and, we can only hope, reveal some juicy campaign gossip.

Thank you for your too kind words which were a greatly welcome addition to my healing and rehab. My word of advice

I hope you will allow yourself to rest and recover. You are an all-star player, and we need you for the long run!

Folks: the secretary's video was a huge success. Thanks so much to our EAP team for getting it done and to the Manila
PAS team for getting it out on a holiday. It was a terrific message.
Am just leaving the Palace independence day fete (looking stiff in my filipiana) where the President grabbed me to say
""please thank Secretary Clinton for that wonderful message. No one has ever done that before and it really showed that
the United States cares about us"". Secretary Romulo stopped me and said ""I heard secretary Clinton's message over the
radio this morning and it was beautiful."".
Everyone from the gate guards to shopping mall vendors stopping me to say they saw/heard Secretary's message.
People are literally thrilled and stunned that our Secretary of State would reach out in such a personal fashion.
Bravo to all of you who made that happen.

Subject: Israeli police seek fraud charges for foreign minister
JERUSALEM, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Israeli police recommended on Sunday that state prosecutors charge
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for bribery, fraud and money laundering. Lieberman, whose
ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party is a key partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition,
accused police of waging a ""campaign of persecution"" against him and said their allegations were
unfounded. In a statement, police said a nine-year investigation found ""a basis of evidence"" against Lieberman
of bribe-taking, fraud, violation of public confidence and obstruction of justice with regard to suspected money
laundering. The investigation, conducted mostly while Lieberman held other government posts, focused on the
transfer of millions of Israeli shekels to shell companies and accounts belonging to people close to him, the
statement said. Lieberman, in a statement released by his spokesman, said there was ""no basis for the police
recommendation"" and expressed confidence he would not be indicted. Police handed their recommendation to
state prosecutors who have to decide whether to charge Lieberman, the latest in a line of Israeli public figures to
face police questioning. Ehud Olmert was forced to resign as prime minister a year ago over a corruption
probe, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The Moldavan-born Lieberman has been denounced by Israeli
Arabs as a racist for his party's introduction of legislation to curb the liberties of citizens deemed as disloyal to
the state, moves widely seen as targeting Israel's Arab minority.

Preparing this to share with my Board; welcome your edits, additions, corrections. Thanks
Observations
1. There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
indicate a 73% approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help
provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
winter.
2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of
two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were
hosted by his Spokesman.
3. Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
and the senior officials all spoke about providing opportunities for this group now (through a ""re-charging"" program
that the Government will fund) for short term study visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.
4. Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the world, is the sixteenth-leading country of origin for students
coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
were substantial visa issues and problems — coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were
launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
countries also stems from the relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness
to take students with low levels of English.

5. We did not hear a single visa complaint during our meetings and public forum. The U.S. embassy is on track to
issue a record number this year and now estimates that 80 percent of all student visa applications are being
granted.
6. The market for study abroad is probably very large. A recent poll by the Kompas newspaper found that 76.3% of
Indonesian students would prefer to go abroad for at least one degree. There are over 4.5 million final-year high
school students and 4.3 million currently enrolled in Indonesian universities, represent about a 17% enrollment
rate about the college-age cohort. The Government wants to raise this to 25% by 2011. This means adding over
400,000 new university students each year and doubling the size of the nation's entire teaching faculty. There are
approximately 154,000 faculty, but only 7% have any form of advance degrees and fewer than 5,000 have a
PhD. Capacity and quality challenges are huge.
7. We were repeatedly told that Higher Education is a top national priority and that the Government would like a
minimum international student enrollment of 5% in order to continue Indonesia's embrace of globalization nd
better prepare their students for work in a globalized world. A Higher Education Reform effort is just getting
underway, with initial emphasis on improving the quality and government support for science and
technology. There are over 2800 institutions of higher education, but only 86 public universities and
polytechnics. Enrollment in the public schools is about 1 million versus 3.4 million in private higher
education. The Government is coming to terms with how best to regulate the private sector; a recently-passed
law in Parliament calls for all private institutions to be brought under greater government control and oversight
over the next 6 years. All boards of trustees will by then have to report on their activities to a government
agency.
8. A very small number of Americans, 132 in 2006-2007, study abroad for credit and most do so on short term,
faculty-led study visits. The highest this number has ever been was only 215 (in 1994-1995). Most of the
delegation did not immediately see how they could send their students here for semester or year-long programs,
but an increasing number of courses are being taught in English at some leading universities. Almost all felt that
only Gadjah Made University in Yogyakarta was well set up to receive U.S. students and able to offer a significant
number of courses for them to take. Other institutions (especially in Bogor and possibly Bandung) offer promising
sites for field research in agriculture, environmental studies ,and marine science. Bali will remain an important
site for those in programs associated with the humanities and cultural studies.
9. Education Ministry officials stressed their desire to move rapidly to build on the momentum of this visit, create new
institutional partnerships, and expand educational programs under the official US-Indonesia Bilateral Partnership
proposed by President SBY (who went to the US six times during the course of his education and is a graduate of
Webster university) and endorsed by Secretary of State Clinton.

Huma,
As I mentioned to you both before, told me in our interview a couple of weeks ago that she was now B5
only interested in two jobs, both of which are out of reach: B6
and (name in play). I tried to interest her in other things at State and USAID,
but she also insists on SES status, which further limits her options given the freeze on SES positions at State. She didn't
seem interested in at any level.
She left saying that she was very disappointed that she hadn't gotten one of her two top preferences and that maybe
she should just stay in her current job, which she loves and which gives her much more money and status than we can
offer. Given her original aspirations for an Under or Assistant Secretary position, I can't imagine that she'd be happy as
for instance, if one were to open up. But let me know if you think she'd be more flexible in the
end.

North Korea frees detained South Korea worker
By KWANG-TAE KIM (AP) – 2 hours ago
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has freed a South Korean worker detained for months in the communist country,
officials said Thursday, brightening prospects for improved relations on the peninsula.
The release came days after Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jung-eun traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to secure the
employee's freedom, and a week after the isolated regime freed two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor
for entering the North illegally in March. That release followed a surprise visit by former President Bill Clinton, who held
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong II.
The 44-year-old technician, surnamed Yoo, worked at an industrial zone in the North's border city of Kaesong, where
about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. He was detained in March for
allegedly denouncing the North's political system.
Though one of the few joint projects still running, the complex's viability has come under questions in recent months as
the North refused to release Yoo and demanded a massive increase in payments and recent at the industrial park. It now
has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
""It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late,"" presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a ""consistent policy"" toward North Korea.

Lee did not elaborate, but South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's government has taken a hard-line approach toward
North Korea, and the North responded by cutting off most ties and halting or curtailing key joint projects except for the
Kaesong complex.
A council made up of South Korean companies operating in Kaesong welcomed Yoo's release and expressed hope it
would ""improve frozen South-North relations and revitalize"" the troubled complex.
The North, however, is still holding four South Korean fishermen whose boat was seized last month after straying
accidentally into northern waters. North Korea told the South earlier Thursday that its investigation into the case is still
continuing, Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. No details were given.
Ahead of the news of Yoo's release Thursday, about 100 demonstrators gathered in central Seoul to demand the release
of the detained worker and the fishermen. Some burned a North Korean flag and photos of Kim.
Hyundai has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the industrial zone and a joint tourist project promoted by more
liberal South Korean governments in the past. But renewed tension between the rivals has seen a suspension of trips to
the North by South Korean tourists and a dramatic reduction in the number of South Koreans working in the industrial
zone.
The two Koreas technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.
Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.

• Senator Webb first delivered a prepared statement, in which he said his visit to Burma had three purposes:

[trespassing] incident was regrettable but not mean-spirited.
• With ASSK, he said he had discussed elections and sanctions issues, but declined to characterize the content of
their conversation.
• With the leadership, he said he had raised a wide range of issues, including elections. He conveyed to the
generals that it would be hard for the world to view the Burmese elections as free and fair without the
participation of ASSK and her supporters. Asked whether free and fair elections are possible given the Burmese
constitution's structure, Webb said the constitution does not necessarily constrain elections.
• Senator Webb explained he was not a U.S. Government envoy. Asked whether his visit would trigger a review
of U.S. Burma policy, the Senator responded that Secretary Clinton had already called for a review and that he
would discuss his visit with the Secretary.
• Asked why he was received by the Burmese leadership while the UN Secretary General was not, the Senator
referred to his 18-year record of working on Southeast Asia issues and his record in Vietnam. He did not
characterize his own position on sanctions. With respect to human rights groups' fear that his visit would lend
legitimacy the regime, Webb firmly restated his qualifications and record.
• The Senator indicated that he viewed this as a possible opening for progress, but did not make any indications or
suggestions on next steps.

Hi Burns,
I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I ""do what I can"" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
""Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu.""
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.
Lyn Lusi

Dear Mrs Clinton,
If We followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;

and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate
for the physical plant that will enable them to serve their patients even better than before, and train the next generation
of doctors in an environment where it is possible to practice excellent medicine.
We remain, respectfully,
Yours sincerely,

COMMENT
Clinton can deliver a tough message to India
By Strobe Talbott
Published: July 16 2009 20:06
When Hillary Clinton arrives in India on Friday, the US secretary of state will no doubt
strike the upbeat tone that befits relations between the world's two largest
democracies. But she is expected also to engage her hosts candidly on two issues that
have been contentious in the past and may be in future: climate change and nuclear
non-proliferation.
In both areas, President Barack Obama's positions are radically different from his
predecessor's. Unlike George W. Bush, Mr Obama understands the need for a rules-
based international system that will regulate and reduce levels of greenhouse gas
emissions and nuclear weaponry. In particular, Mr Bush, like the Republican-controlled
US Senate of the late 1990s, opposed the Kyoto protocol on climate change and the
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). He also had little use for the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), even though it was largely an American
initiative going back to the dawn of the cold war.
Those Bush policies suited many Indians. In their view, a global regime to restrict
carbon emissions could hinder India's growth, while the CTBT and the NPT blocked
265
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763800 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763800 Date: 06/30/2015
their right to develop the nuclear-weapons capability their government demonstrated
when it conducted a series of tests in 1998. Under Mr Bush, the US and India
negotiated a pact on co-operation in civil nuclear power that will, when the details of its
implementation are worked out, grant India an exemption from the terms of the NPT.
Mr Obama, however, is committed to ratifying the CTBT, strengthening the NPT, and
pursuing other treaties to prevent the spread of dangerous material and technology. He
also intends for the US to be part of the international effort to replace the Kyoto
protocol with a treaty-based climate-control regime including India, China and other
emerging powers.
As a result, on both proliferation and climate change, many Indians regard Mr Bush
with nostalgia and Mr Obama with muted apprehension. Mrs Clinton, however, is seen
as a staunch friend of India. Her trip there as first lady in 1995 helped break the ice in
US-Indian relations after 50 years of estrangement, paving the way for President Bill
Clinton's visit in 2000. She is therefore in an ideal position to deliver a message in New
Delhi that is both reassuring and cautionary.
The US administration knows it cannot coax or bully India into formally joining the NPT,
nor will it renege on the civil nuclear deal it inherited from Mr Bush. At the same time,
Washington policymakers hope that India's Congress party-led government, now that it
has been returned to power with an increased mandate, will join the US in tightening
the verification authorities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, accelerating
negotiations to stop the production of fissile material (the stuff at the core of nuclear
warheads) and bringing the CTBT into force.
These steps would make India's region safer, since Pakistan might follow suit in a
positive direction, just as it did in a negative one when it conducted a nuclear test
shortly after India's in 1998. A similar appeal to self-interest might prevail with respect
to climate change. Since much of India's population lives in rural and coastal areas, it
is acutely vulnerable to the devastation of agricultural lands and rising sea levels that
come with global warming.
Key figures in India are beginning to accept the idea of a global compact on climate
change. However, they are focused on the 12-to-1 disparity between the average
American's carbon footprint and the average Indian's. Therefore they want progress
towards parity in the final agreement. If the US achieves the 80 per cent cut in
emissions by 2050 that Mr Obama supports, the gap between the US and Indian
footprints per capita would shrink dramatically.
Indians (like many Americans) need to be persuaded to see the urgency of prompt
action. There are few voices more persuasive than that of the Indian scientist R. K.
Pachauri, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change who shared the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. He believes that the world has about six years

to impose drastic and effective reductions on greenhouse gases. That will only happen
if Mr Pachauri's and Mrs Clinton's governments can make common cause.

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. ""People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,"" said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. ""Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,"" he said on Wednesday.
Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists were beaten
by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report
said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. ""We are not
against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,"" Japan's Kyodo news agency
quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in
New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan,
China and Russia, saying ""the six-party talks are gone forever."" The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within
the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last
weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North
Korea and the U.S. were slim. ""Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective
approach"" to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks ""cheated""
North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more
details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the
U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket
launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range
missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing
international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Korea's
nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. ""North Korea will
be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,"" State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in
Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to ""small children"" demanding attention. At
a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North ""has no friends left."" North Korea's Foreign
Ministry described her Thursday as ""a funny lady"" who sometimes ""looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a
pensioner going shopping.""

an even more effective partner in meeting common challenges, including reducing nuclear arsenals, securing vulnerable
nuclear materials, contending with nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, defeating violent extremism, and
advancing global security and economic growth.
Working together to advance security and prosperity for the American and Russian people is the focus of our effort to

Dear Chief of Staff,
Following our short exchange of views, on the margins of your last meeting with the African
Diplomatic Group on Food Security, and yesterday's press release on Secretary of State's visit to
Africa, I wish to express my deepest appreciation for your personal support in the positive
consideration of the invitation the Cape Verdian Minister of Foreign Affairs extended to Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton.
The Cape Verdian authorities see this visit as an important landmark in the bilateral relations between
Cape Verde and the US and an opportunity to discuss ways to strenghten those relations and our
cooperation at the international level where we share various views and goals. We therefore look
forward to the visit with much enthusiasm.
In this line, I wish to reiterate that the Embassy of Cape Verde and myself stand ready to facilitate
and contribute in any way deemed necessary to ensure an adequate preparation of the visit.
Please feel free to contact me at my following e-mails:
official e-mail
or
My private one
or by cell phone
It will be for me a personal pleasure to welcome you in my country.
Best regards,
Fatima Veiga

Subject: U.S. group tells Sudan to speed up vote preparations
KHARTOUM, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Sudan must swiftly approve a budget to pay for elections in April and speed up
preparations if the vote is to go ahead on time, the U.S.-based Carter Center which will monitor the ballot said on
Thursday. The votes for the presidency, parliament and other bodies is part of the democratic transformation promised
in the 2005 peace deal that ended a north-south civil war that lasted two decades. They will be the first multi-party
elections in over 20 years. ""The Center reported serious concerns about slippage in the overall electoral calendar,"" a
report said, adding the organization was also worried about new laws and continued restrictions on civil liberties. ""(It is
an) ambitious schedule but will only be viable if the government of national unity and the NEC (National Elections
Commission) take immediate action to ensure that further delays are avoided,"" the report said.

WASHINGTON (Wall Street Journal) - The White House will shelve Bush administration plans to build a
missile-defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to people familiar with the matter, a move
likely to cheer Moscow and roil the security debate in Europe. The U.S. will base its decision on a
thquirainati.an that Iran's long-range missile program has not progressed as rapidly as previously estimated,
rca.cing the tlirfit to the, continental U.S. and major European capitals, according to current and former U.S.

Subject: AMCIT suspected of abuse of minors in Liberia
Cheryl: My staff assistance received a call from the ""Line"" saying you might want a short informal note to send to the
Secretary on the situation with the American UNMIL employee suspected of abusing minors in Liberia. Below is a
shorter and updated version of what I sent you earlier. I will be on leave for a week beginning tomorrow and one my
deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, will be following this issue in my absence. Regards, Johnnie
An American citizen civilian employee of the UN operation in Liberia is suspected of engaging in illegal acts with at least
two underage Liberian girls. The Liberian National Police, who received a DVD of the acts, told Embassy officials earlier
today they had identified the American citizen and confirmed the identity of two girls—an 11-year-old and another
between 12-15 years of age. These are crimes in Liberia as well as in the United States.
We are working with Liberian authorities and the UN to ensure that the American citizen is made to answer for these
allegations. In the meantime, the Department is working with Department of Justice lawyers to determine if the
American citizen can be tried in the United States. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, currently in the Department
chairing a promotion panel, has spoken to President Johnson-Sirleaf about the importance of this case. It appears that
the UN will waive any immunity the American may have and that the Liberians will take the American citizen into
custody.
Coming on the heels of your trip to Africa, and the emphasis you placed on gender-based violence and sex crimes, we
are making every effort to ensure that this individual is brought to justice, including by offering whatever resources the
Liberians need to conduct the best possible investigation. The Legal Attache, based in Freetown, is currently en route to
Liberia to assist.

Cheryl
Hope this finds you well. I wanted to update you on the success of the video and also share a new idea with you. Give
the statistical results below, I honestly believe this is the State Departments first ever successful instance of policy
advocacy via viral video and the impact we have raised is worth noting. I have heard comments from all over the
building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising
awareness/attention on a major foreign policy initiative through compelling, and viral video -- the Department of State
has raised the bar.
It is hard to read the traffic exactly to their sites and ours but here are some initial stats:
Top line: Using State.gov, America.gov, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and more, we have use new media and connection
technology tools to reach over an estimated 100K audiences domestically and internationally through the video on Food
Security and ultimately have brought press and attention to a new focus. This video is engaging in that it raises
awareness and education on a critical foreign policy issue.
1: It is one of the top 20 videos viewed on our Youtube channel, with over 5K views and rising. Considering how
much video we generate through the daily press briefings and videos through S remarks daily, I think this carries

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764287 Date: 07/31/2015
tremendous weight that in a short amount of time and little push to reach out to communities we have raised
the bar for engaging content through video.
2. Many organizations and users on Youtube have picked up the video and reposted on their channels, for
examples it is has been picked up heavily in China from one user who generated 3K views on his own already
and I have been told that it has been posted on major Ethiopian blogs through their video channels as well.
3. Over 12,000 (estimated) have visited our main video page through State.gov where the video was featured.
4. Almost 9K people have visited the Global Food Security page through State.gov to get more information.
5. Through pushing out on social networking presences at State, we have reached over 65,000 people who
subscribe and follow the Department of State and we pushed this video and the broader FS page to those
communities through Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Next Steps:
1. We are making DVD's to give to posts
2. Working on distributing to bloggers for continued use
3. Will feature and push video to a larger audience when op-ed runs through a second push
4. Will work to feature prominently on World Food Day
5. Working to translate and subtitle video for usage in countries around the world.
New Idea:
Cheryl, wanted to talk to you about a new idea that I have presented before but thought about using for FS in a modified
form. I discussed with Caitlin and wanted to see if you thought this was a good idea.
This proposal is to ask that Secretary Clinton begin an online conversation on Food Security where she can engage with
people at home and abroad.
1. Through a video announcement she announces the opening of a global and engaging talk worldwide talk on
global hunger and invites people to submit questions on the topic. People can submit questions via video, text,
email, comment.
2. The community votes and comments on the best questions submitted by one another and votes on the best
ones.
3. After two weeks, Secretary Clinton answers then the top five questions in her own response video. *** We
could even bring person with best question to DC to be a citizen journalist for a day and ask the top questions in
person.
4. We then use this video as a way to talk about the most frequently asked questions on global hunger, HRC's
responses to them and we have engaged a global community on the topic.

Regards, Johnnie
Madam Secretary,
I know you are deeply concerned about reports of ongoing violence and attacks against women that have occurred in
Guinea-Conakry. I want to let you know what actions the Africa Bureau is taking to address this crisis.
I met with Guinean Foreign Minister Alexandre Cece Loua this morning at 9:00. I expressed our deep outrage at the
brutal actions of Guinean security forces against protesters on September 28, which resulted in 157 deaths, hundreds
more injured, and the widespread rape of women. I will separately provide you with a formal readout of the meeting. I
have also sent one of my Deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, to Conakry, where he met yesterday with President Dadis Camara and
expressed the same outrage.
We are pressing the government to take immediate actions to stop the violence and to restore constitutional order. We
have asked Dadis Camara to step aside and to seek exile in Morocco or another French-speaking country. We have also
asked Guinea to invite in observers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to monitor the
actions of the military and developments toward a democratic transition. In addition, we have indicated that we will
seek an international investigation in order to arrest and punish the perpetrators of the violence.
We have indicated that if the Government of Guinea does not act rapidly, we will pursue sanctions against government
officials. In all of these actions, we are consulting with the French, whose views and actions closely mirror ours, as well
as with several west African states, including Liberia and Senegal.

respect to humanitarian assistance to Somalia and the potential for diversion. She indicated she would let Eric Schwartz
know where things stand.

No one has yet seen the McChrystal Report.
Iraq
• Jack stressed his continued concern over funding for the transfer of police training responsibilities from Defense to
State, noting that it remains ""highly ambiguous."" (The estimated cost is an initial $500 million, with an additional $700
million a year in expenses.) Defense is insisting it does not have money to transfer to State for this purpose, and the
idea of a Supplemental is problematic, not the least because the timing would not coincide with the transfer of
responsibilities. Jack is concerned that we will look like we are holding up the transfer.
Chinese Tires
• Jim reported that there had been another meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday where there was interagency
agreement on the ""first best option,"" but disagreement over other options. The Chinese are in town for negotiations
and there will be another meeting tomorrow after the first round.
Baghdad Management Issues
Eric Boswell noted that the Department would extend
Eric also noted that the roof of the USAID building in Baghdad had collapsed.

insist on a debate and roll call vote for Tom Shannon. DeMint apparently warned, however, that any ""substantive
change"" in our current policy vis-à-vis Honduras would jeopardize both nominations.
• Codel Levin will be heading to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, but will not overlap with Jack Lew's stay in those
places.
Legal Issues
• Harold said that one fallout from the renewed focus on Libya is that some former claimants are coming back
seeking new relief.
Hurricane Jimena
• I noted that Hurricane Jimena is expected to make landfall in Baja early tomorrow morning as a powerful Category
4 or 5 Hurricane. Embassy Mexico City and Consulate General Tijuana have issued warden messages and Consular
Affairs has put out a travel alert advising citizens to avoid the areas likely to be hit. Many hotels in the path of the storm
have been largely evacuated, but there are still many Americans who could be affected. The Ops Center is in close touch
with our missions in Mexico to monitor conditions.
Public Affairs
• PJ anticipates questions about Iran's alleged willingness to restart talks and whether the Secretary will meet with
Zelaya.
Deputies Meeting Highlights
Sri Lanka
• The War Crimes Office said that the report to the Hill on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka is due by September 21.
They have prepared a 60-page draft which is now circulating for clearance. The report covers the period up to May, but
Jack encouraged the Office to consider including later material if it would be helpful.

Pakistani Internally Displaced Persons
• Eric Schwartz said that the Op-ed in today's post by Morton Abramowitz criticizing the U.S. and Pakistan for
allegedly forcing the return of IDPs into Swat and other areas is simply not true. Eric said he would call Mort to discuss
this.
Export Controls
• Andrew Shapiro noted that the interagency process aimed at ""reforming"" export controls gets underway today.
The goal is to have something to present to Deputies in six weeks.
Brazilian Oil Development
• David Goldwyn said that Brazil's proposed regulations for developing its vast offshore petroleum reserves were
disappointing. Brazil seems to have opted for a nationalist model that will substantially delay bringing on line the most
promising non-OPEC source of oil in years.
H1N1
• OES reported that the Administration will release its report on H1N1 inthe Southern Hemisphere today. The
analysis of the virus in several developed countries in the region suggests that it has not mutated and that the vaccine
being developed should be effective. It is still not clear, however, whether one or two doses will be required.

Mary Landrieu asked me to attend a dinner about foster care. Do you have any details? Also she mentioned an event at
the White House about adoption and foster care. Have you heard anything about this? Can you call Landrieu's office to
follow up?
I told Kouchner I would call him on 8/31. Pls remind me.

I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House.
She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this
She advises that we need to give advance notice -
There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.
This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.
Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.

United States Institute of Peace: Background
Proposals for the creation of a government ""peace"" agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a ""Peace
Office"" on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to
establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the
Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known
as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace
academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board
of Directors took place in 1986.
The USIP Act established ""an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government
through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace
information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and
peoples of the world without recourse to violence.""
USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy
research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country-
specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include:
® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate
dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and
educating the public through events, films, and other outreach.
O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries.
® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria,
Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti.
® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

Dear Melanne,
We've been in contact with Salam Alshehri, the project coordinator of the newly launched Entelak school program
Glamour helped create for young girls through Sana'a's Girls World Communication Center. She reports that they are in
contact with Nujood who is in fact in third grade at a private school. While Nujood isn't in the demographic for the
Entelak Project since she's still young enough for public (free) education, she is the role model for the targeted
girls. And since Nujood is the spirit of the Project, Salam and her colleagues are thinking of ways to include her in the
activities and trainings as much as possible.
We've also spoken to Delphine Minoui, the French reporter who first covered Nujood's case and has since co-written
Nujood's autobiography. Delphine has taken on the funding of Nujood's private schooling and confirms that Nujood is in
fact still attending school. CNN got it wrong apparently,"",

Cheryl,
We spoke with 10, EEB, and Amb. Cousin after the meeting today and came up with the following revision to S's call
points. We decided the best language would be for the Secretary to say that if UNSYG cannot co-host, that she would
welcome the participation of his representative. The important point here is that we do not want the FAO head -
Jacques Diouf —to end-up co-hosting the UNGA event, and everyone agreed there was a danger Ban ki-Moon would
suggest he do so. In the background at the bottom I included a point stressing that we do not want Diouf to co-host.
Thanks,
Marisa

Cheryl, regard the desire of the Economic Club of DC to invite HRC to speak (which we
consulted on a week ago), they're now broadening the invite to be any time in the fall—which
I'd think might increase the chances of it suited her purposes. I'm attaching a copy of the letter
they'll send in via any channel you designate (scheduler, public affairs officer, or whatever).
HRC did call this weekend and we covered a pretty wide range of substantive issues. I
decided, however, not to bother her with this matter, which I hope was the right call on my part.
Also, Jake put in a call to me last week. We didn't connect. I don't know if that's OBE as a
result of HRC's call. In any event, I'm around this week, though hanging out as much as
ossible with

Cheryl, I hope for your sake that you don't get this email for a while and that you're getting
some genuine R&R. Anyway, David Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group is asking my advice on
whether HRC would welcome an invitation to address the Economic Club of Washington in
September. Obviously business-heavy. Audience: 400-500, screen questions for after talk and
he can provide them in advance; media coverage, etc. I told him I had no idea but would
check. Depending on her outreach strategy for the fall, it could be a good audience, esp. if she
wanted to talk about issues like China, the development, the role of the private sector, or
energy/climate—i.e., the econ aspect/component of foreign policy. If I should be going
elsewhere for this kind of steer, lemme know. Regards, Strobe

Don't know where to send this... I'll share with you... I think its worthy of your consideration... It would need to happen,
by phone, within the next 7 days as I understand it...
Sojourners, as you know, has a great magazine... has been one of that orgs stalwarts since the beginning and during the
most recent magazine awards programs it was the only faith-based magazine to receive top honors across the board,
receiving the ""best of"" several categories... it's a good product... they have a nationwide subscribership of about
350,000... plus it has an online presence...
Several times a year Jim will conduct an interview with someone he feels is making a significant impact on the nation
and world... He has been deeply impacted by your personal focus on women and the impoverished and would like to
interview you for feature in one of the Sojourner upcoming additions... it would be all about your work and focus on
women and the impoverished... a totally positive, enlightening and feel good piece... He recently interviewed Bono for
this feature slot...
I hope you are interested... I think it would be very smart considering attitudes out there in the progressive faith
community these days... Your witness on your work, with such a strong endorsement by Jim would be positive across the
board...

Cheryl,
As discussed, please see the attached draft cable for the Secretary's approval. The draft letter text is pasted below.
WHA would like the Secretary to send a letter to all the UNASUR (Union of South American Nations) foreign ministers
regarding support for the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). UNASUR is having its summit meeting
on August 28 and WHA would like the letter sent as soon as possible so that it can be read and processed before the
summit. Please note that Steinberg himself has NOT signed off on this letter (his staff has), but we are expecting to
hear from him this morning. Please tell me if you think this should be held till he weighs in.

Sensitive But Unclassified
UNASUR Letter on Colombia
• Cheryl and Jim said they both thought that there were things missing from the latest WHA draft of a letter from
the Secretary to UNASUR members. The goal is to get the final version to the Secretary as soon as possible.
Mitchell meeting with Netanvahu
• Cheryl noted that the Secretary will receive a readout from Senator Mitchell on his meeting with Prime Minister
Netanyahu shortly.
Libya
• Bill reported that Jeff Feltman has not heard back definitively on Qaddafi's decision about staying in New Jersey
during UNGA. Pat Kennedy said he had talked to USUN about possibly allowing Qaddafi to pitch his tent in Fort
Hamilton in Brooklyn. Mike Polt noted that he had spoken to Congressman Rothman twice yesterday, and that
Rothman expressed hope we would have a definitive answer from the Libyans by Sunday, when the Rabbi in
Englewood, N.J. plans a protest at the Libyan Residence.
H1N1
• Pat said he had received a call from John Brennan thanking State for providing data on H1N1 outbreaks in the
Southern Hemisphere and asking relevant desks to let their embassies know that the USG would be issuing a
report on this.

• Harold said he had signed off on an action memo to the Secretary along with WHA and F regarding restrictions
on assistance to Honduras. (I subsequently confirmed that the package has not yet come forward to the Line -
it is awaiting WHA front office clearance and Jim Steinberg's final approval.)
• Derek Chollet said that S/P has drafted the options memo for the Secretary on the upcoming Presidential
election in Honduras.

• Ian said he anticipated questions on Qaddafi and UNGA, Senator Mitchell's meeting with PM Netanyahu, and
the results of the delegation to Honduras. He noted in this regard that the decision to suspend NIV issuances in
Honduras attracted relatively little attention, but any decision with respect to a possible cut off in assistance
would attract a great deal more.
• Ian noted that CNN is running with a story based apparently on a State IG report faulting the Department for
being slow in planning for the safety and effectiveness of U.S. civilians in Iraq in the wake of the U.S. military
withdrawal. Pat said he thought this was based on an old IG report. Jim said that our line should be that we are
confronting the implications of the military withdrawal, that we have an elaborate planning process in place,
and that we are focused heavily on the safety and security of remaining USG employees.
• RI noted that the Secretary will issue a statement on Senator Kennedy's death, and that Senator Mitchell also
would put out a message in his capacity as a former Senate colleague.
• Finally, PJ reported that ABC has not yet given up on the story related to a Soviet-style effort by the Russians to
entrap/smear a Department employee in Moscow. (The incident in question stems from the time the employee
did not work for the Department, but was studying Russian language in Vladivostok.) We are trying to convince
ABC that this is not a story and if there is a story, it is that the Russians continue to use old techniques to try to
entrap our employees.

1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.
2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).
We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in
about a month, following a final review by both sides. As
noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States
access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate
effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in
Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any
U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall
increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or
U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia.
3.(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM
Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,
including the importance of coordinating our public
affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).
There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional
referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
will attend the summit provided that a full range of
regional security matters can be discussed, not just the
DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected
UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional
security issues beyond the DCA.
4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and

summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
range of regional security topics during the summit, and
not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host

Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:
I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
United States supports the formation and effective
functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
and ensure the best possible communication between
nations.
As you know, our common neighbor,
Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy
alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious
illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened
the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow
by violence and corruption successive,
democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions
of these groups also threaten the security of other
countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many
ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have
beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My
country is proud of the role we have been able to play in
this effort.
This battle is far from won. Our governments and people
are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves
and our institutions from such threats. I am certain
these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming
summit, including the recently concluded Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the
sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in
the hemisphere and the questions your government may have
regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope
the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my
government and the Colombian government have helped
address those questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to make several key
points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a
bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our
cooperation on security challenges within Colombia,
permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian
26fi
facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on
Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that
does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other
nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat
drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a
whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of
U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase
in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not
seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from
Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in
advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be
based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity of states, and
non-interventionism.
We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
reach out to us to seek clarification.
The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the
organization to address a range of security issues that
affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
deciding to discuss these matters. The security
challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
that a collective and collaborative approach to these
matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

MOSCOW (AP)-A Russian deputy defense minister has confirmed that the military has scrapped a plan to deploy missiles
near Poland. Vladimir Popovkin says that U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to dump the Bush-era plan to deploy
missile defense sites in Eastern Europe has made the deployment of Iskander short-range missiles in Russia's Kaliningrad
region unnecessary. Popovkin's statement on Ekho Moskvy radio Saturday confirmed previous similar statements by
other Russian officials.

Nalbandian statement: ""The Turkish side is informed and we are confident that they realize that we exclude the
conditioning of the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations on steps toward the settlement of the Karabakh
conflict. Trying to link these two processes could lead to the failure of both. A number of countries, including
those of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, have the same position. They have said many times that the normalization
of relations between Turkey and Armenia must be without preconditions. With this mutual understanding, we
have started and conducted negotiations and come to agreements that are reflected in the initialed protocols. If
the Turkish leadership has problems with the signing of these documents, they should not try to solve them by
distorting the spirit, essence, and goals of the initialed documents. The signing and implementation of the
agreed documents is a process that is full of difficulties. Nevertheless, Armenia is ready to respect the
agreements and move forward If the current authorities in Turkey are not ready to accept the fact of the
genocide perpetrated in the Ottoman Empire, then they are at least obliged to show respect toward the
survivors of the Armenian genocide and their descendants.""

Subject: UNESCO update
Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired ""public relations"" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice today with a ""message from the Foreign
Minister."" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.
A/S Feltman notes "" maybe we've become a convenient excuse."" A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.

Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.
Monday's vote is midday EDT.

POTUS Asia Travel
• Bill said he will be meeting with his Indonesian counterpart today to discuss.
Helicopter support for Emb Baghdad
• Pat Kennedy noted that Blackwater's contract ends Sept. 4, but problems have arisen with the successor being
ready to assume helo support tasks; they have not secured the necessary helos nor obtained the required
certificates of airworthiness and are in breach of their contract. Rather than shut down Embassy operations
after Sept. 4, it may be necessary to give Blackwater a short (perhaps 2 months) extension until the successor is
ready to perform. M is talking to Chris Hill about our options; he would need to discuss this with the Iraqis if
Blackwater is extended.
Libya
• Rich Verma noted the planned demonstration in Englewood, New Jersey this weekend in opposition to Qaddafi's
desire to stay there during UNGA. There is now a possibility that Qaddafi will stay at a hotel in Manhattan. Bill
will talk to Jeff Feltman and hopes this will be resolved today; if so, H said they would inform Rep. Rothman and
Senator Lautenberg.
Hearings
• Rich reported that Chris Hill is scheduled to appear before the SFRC on Sept 9 and the HFAC on Sept 10, perhaps
with Gen. Odierno, although Odierno may not be available those dates. There was discussion of the pros and
cons of appearing with or without Gen. Odierno, given past precedent on Iraq and Afghanistan testimony and
the general rule that ambassadors usually do not testify on the Hill.
• Upcoming confirmation hearings include those for Bob Hormats on Sept 9, perhaps with Jose Fernandez, and a
panel of EUR ambassadorial-nominees on Sept 10. Also, Richard Holbrooke will testify on Sept 15 before the
House Foreign Operations subcommittee.
Honduras
• Harold Koh raised the memo to the Secretary on Honduras; it was decided to discuss it in a separate meeting.

D(L) Travel
• Piper said Jack Lew will return to the office Monday and depart on travel Tuesday afternoon, returning Sept
10. Cheryl noted that the Secretary would like to convene a conference call with him on Monday.
Belarus at UNGA
• Jake noted the issue of whether to invite Belarus to the President's reception at UNGA; the consensus was that
he should do so.
Public Affairs
• Ian Kelly said PA anticipates questions on Honduras, upcoming Mitchell meetings, and the possibility of a
Bosworth trip at today's briefing. PJ Crowley noted European press reporting of comments by former UK FS
Jack Straw that the British had not provided assurances to us in the 90's that the convicted Lockerbie bomber
would serve out his full sentence in Scotland.
Pakistan
• The story on Pakistan proliferation may come out over the weekend.

Dear Melanne:
I am drawing your attenrtion to the following report in the leading daily
newspaper in Bangladesh. All other papers carried the same news.
This is a report on the Prime Minister Hasina's speech on the floor
of the parliament. High-lighted section of the report refers to me
without naming name but giving her usual description of me.
See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts
she has about me. I invite you to be a peace-maker! Otherwise it will become
explosive for nothing. PM Hasina is coming to NY for General Assembly
meeting, and will have a meeting with Sec H during her visit.
See you soon.

Prime Mnister Hasina Warns
The Daily Star, Dhaka, September 17, 2009
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
being failed to capture it.
The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
their voices.
Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, ""We used
to walk out from parliament sessions, boycott it but we used to return to
the House again.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764707 Date: 07/31/2015
Meanwhile, the parliament session was adjourned till 4:00pm on October 4.
Sheikh Hasina, also ruling Awami League (AL) president, urged people to keep vigil against recurrence of incidents like
BDR mutiny to reverse the democratic strides. She also urged the people not to be misguided by any 'false campaign.'
""While running the government and doing development works, we find continued obstacles in every step from the
'special quarter', benefited by undemocratic government, who earlier had captured power through undemocratic
means, So, I urge the countrymen to be cautious so that the democratic trend continues,"" she told the parliament.
The prime minister was speaking at a discussion titled 'democracy and political tolerance' on the occasion of the
International Day of Democracy.
Following an hour long discussion, the House passed a resolution by which Bangladesh will also observe the
International Day of Democracy through holding a discussion in the parliament every year.
Inter-Parliamentary Union decided to observe September 15 of every year as International Day of Democracy in the
context of a resolution adopted by the United Nations in 2007.
The International Day of Democracy was first observed in 2008 but Bangladesh could not observe the day as unelected
caretaker government ruled the country during that time.
Referring to the sugar price, Sheikh Hasina told the House that a big conspiracy is going on regarding sugar price. Price of
sugar is being raised though stock of sugar is available. ""We are investigating the matter and action will be taken against
those who are responsible for it,""
said the Leader of the House.
On plotting of the conspiracy, Sheikh Hasina said people who wanted to sit in power without election are still hatching
conspiracy against her government.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764707 Date: 07/31/2015
Pointing out the two years of the past caretaker government, Hasina said, ""Various formulas were floated during that
time by those who would lose security money if contest any election.""
She also disclosed in parliament that many proposals were given to her
(Hasina) during that time including offering her the status of a prime minister without participating in elections, which
she rejected.
Without mentioning any name, the prime minister said, those who wanted to capture power by creating new political
parties are still continuing their activities to capture power.
""Those persons who had failed to float a new political party, exploit
people, get huge interest from poor people and remain in disguise of good
men wearing good dresses are still busy hatching a conspiracy against the
government,"" said Hasina, who was sent to a makeshift jail during the
anti-graft drive of the past caretaker government.
She, however, hailed the caretaker regime for holding a free and fair election, which she claimed as the best election
since 1973.
The AL Chief Hasina told lawmakers that the country has been pushed back economically, socially and culturally by
applying the undemocratic and military rule while only a special quarter became rich but the majority people remained
ignored.
The premier vowed that her government is committed to materialise all its election pledges to fulfil the desire of the
people.
Hasina said her party believes in the definition of democracy given by Abraham Lincoln who said Democracy means--by
the People, of the People, for the People.

elected government,"" she said.
AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Advocate Fazle Rabbi Mia, Abdul Matin

Feingold reportedly expressed some reservations about the nomination but said he was keeping an open mind. Frankly,
that's not a great sign, since he's been overwhelmingly positive in his meetings with just about all our other candidates.
I can report that H has done just about everything we can do. We've done countless meetings and briefings and had
several mock hearing sessions. That's in addition to all the work on QFRs, counsel questions, testimony, and his SFRC
questionairre. But despite all this work, I still have some very serious concerns heading into tomorrow's confirmation

PARIS (AP) UNESCO says a career diplomat from Bulgaria has defeated a controversial Egyptian candidate to head the
United Nations agency for culture and education. The chairman of UNESCO's executive board says Bulgaria's
ambassador to France, Irina Bokova, has beaten longtime Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosny in secret
balloting. UNESCO's press office says Bokova won 31 to 27 Tuesday in a suspenseful fifth round. The Egyptian was long
considered a favorite, despite his threat last year to burn Israeli books, and Egypt's contentious record of cultural
censorship under his watch. Hosny apologized for the book-burning comment, but many Jewish activists said he was
unfit to be the U.N.'s guardian of culture.

® Jim said that he had spoken to Senator DeMint about holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. DeMint did not say
anything negative about either nominee, but will insist on a full floor discussion as the price of a vote. (He sees
no prospect Zelaya will come back into power in Honduras.) H will follow up to see what more can be done to
engage with DeMint on the substance of his concerns. Cheryl noted that if we are not going to make any
additional movement soon, we should proceed to a floor vote. The issue then will be how much time DeMint
demands.

® In Honduras, Pat noted that the mission is also closed and that, despite the proximity of our mission to the
Brazilian things seem fine. I noted that there were reports this morning that police had fired tear gas to break
up a demonstration. WHA reported in the subsequent meeting that we have urged the de facto regime to act
with restraint and not use force. We are also waiting for a readout of a meeting between Zelaya's supporters
and de facto regime members that took place last night. Jim indicated he wanted to call everyone together later
to review our strategy going forward.

The Power Grid
Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House,
returned from the brink.
•Published Oct 11, 2009
On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care
bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the
legislation instead. ""It's just too weak,"" he told me. ""It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real
competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies."" And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the
bill. His political assessment was even harsher: ""It's effectively dead,"" he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus
plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone
gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more
for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as
Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to
nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean
into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest
and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill
eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care
paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has
been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have
a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé
and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,
wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in
other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a
matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. ""This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship
that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,"" he says. ""You didn't have the president out there
speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort
with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback"" Weiner laughs. ""Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-
hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum
that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and
death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of
what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;
he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. ""It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this
has become my issue,"" Weiner says. ""If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening."" Weiner allows that
he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the
cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an
equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a
""government takeover"" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House
pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and
1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently
clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that ""up to
now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple
of hours."" And he's apparently had no change of heart. ""The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,"" he tells
me.
Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his
consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to

exchange with Obama over the former's ideas about how the latter might better prosecute the case for reform. When I ask Weiner
about the incident, he refuses to divulge details, but notes that when it was over, the president said to him drily, ""I hope you're
enjoying your last trip on Air Force One."" ""He was kidding—I think,"" adds Weiner. In truth, Weiner has been on the receiving end of
zero complaints from the White House for his potshots. ""I see Rahm [Emanuel] at the House gym every morning, and he's never
beefed to me about this once,"" Weiner says. ""I think he needs this pressure from the left—it serves them. They needed someone to
generate the heat of their base to give them the space to be the moderate voice. I'm convinced that if it weren't me, they'd have to
create me."" Weiner's theory is self-serving, but it makes a kind of sense. Over the summer, Weiner, by threatening to bottle up a vote
on the main House health-care bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee, forced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to grant him a floor
vote this fall on a single-payer plan. Weiner believes in single-payer as a matter of policy—but he also sees the political advantage of
putting forward a proposal that will at once satisfy certain elements of the base and create the appearance that the public option is
itself a compromise toward the center. And his adamant advocacy of a robust public option itself generates breathing room for the sort
of modified version that might win approval in both the House and Senate. What Weiner has no doubt about now is that the final
legislation will include just such a provision—because without it, there simply aren't the votes in the House to pass a bill. ""I think
President Obama will put his finger on the scale at some point,"" he says. In the end, it's going to be simpler to corral one or two
senators to accept a public option with some modifications than it's going to be to get a hundred House members off their rebellious
screed. From what Weiner can divine from Emanuel and others in the White House, this kind of brass-tacks calculation—not the
policy merits, not even the long-range political ramifications—is all that matters now. Obama's bizarro, out-of-nowhere acquisition of
the Nobel Peace Prize at the end of last week notwithstanding, the president has had a rough few months and badly needs to put a win
on the board. And no one is looking to make that any harder than it's been already. To illustrate why that means the public option
will prevail, Weiner colorfully sketches out his vision of the endgame: ""Obama goes to Nancy and says, 'I've decided I'm giving up
the public option.' And she says, 'Well, dude, I can't get this done then.' So then he goes to Harry Reid and says, 'We're going with
the public option. What do we have to do in Nebraska to get Ben Nelson onboard?' That's a much easier conversation."" E-mail:

Vilsack told a powerful story about going to a school feeding program while he was in kenya in august for agoa. At lunch
time, he spooned usg donated porrage into the kids red cups. After lunch he asked the kids what their favorate part of
school was. He expected to hear ""recess"" or maybe reading. Instead every single child responded with ""lunch - because
it is the only meal I get everyday"". Vilsack was glad for what we were doing, but the event made him realize how much
more there is to do.

Keynote lunch speaker was Indra Nooyi, the chair and ceo of Pepsi Co. She noted that this event is growing in both size
and importance every year. Attendence at the lunch alone was over 950 people including Secretary Vilsack and
ministers from many countries. She specifically complemented Secretary Clinton's role in the Sept 26 UN event. Nooyi
used much of her address challenging the private sector to do their part in carrying out the strategy unveiled in New
York.
Secretary Vilsack gave a very powerful address that focused on our efforts feed hungry children and the need to do
more. He refered to working with Secretary Clinton or to ""under Secretary Clinton's leadership"" at least 3 times. It was
very well done.

What a remarkable achievement to get the Turks and Armenians to come this far together. You are deservedly getting
good positive press for your efforts.
I just wanted you to know that the women in NI with whom you ""walked the walk"" over the years are eagerly looking
forward to seeing you. They were so incredibly helpful during your campaign telling the story of what you did to support
them, and as we know -- and as they have shown -- women are critical both to the peace process and to the peace
holding. Inez is planning to welcome you with a few words -- as she has done for over a decade. I will be with you all in

relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,"" the source said.
""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
""spend all day Friday together."" However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.
Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20a
new era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,"" the source said.
""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
""spend all day Friday together."" However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.

Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20a
new era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

Subject: (Nytimes) U.S. Accuses Pakistan of Altering Missiles
WASHINGTON — The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally modifying
American-made missiles to expand its capability to strike land targets, a potential
threat to India, according to senior administration and Congressional officials.
The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the United States and
Pakistan, was made in an unpublicized diplomatic protest in late June to Prime
Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.
The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking
Congress to approve $7.5 billion in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when
Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its attentions on fighting
the Taliban, rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.
While American officials say that the weapon in the latest dispute is a conventional one
— based on the Harpoon antiship missiles that were sold to Pakistan by the Reagan
administration as a defensive weapon in the cold war — the subtext of the argument is
growing concern about the speed with which Pakistan is developing new generations of
both conventional and nuclear weapons.
""There's a concerted effort to get these guys to slow down,"" one senior administration
official said. ""Their energies are misdirected.""
At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test
on April 23 — a test never announced by the Pakistanis — that appeared to give the
country a new offensive weapon.

American military and intelligence officials say they suspect that Pakistan has modified
the Harpoon antiship missiles that the United States sold the country in the 198os, a
move that would be a violation of the Arms Control Export Act. Pakistan has denied the
charge, saying it developed the missile itself. The United States has also accused
Pakistan of modifying American-made P-3C aircraft for land-attack missions, another
violation of United States law that the Obama administration has protested.
Whatever their origin, the missiles would be a significant new entry into Pakistan's
arsenal against India. They would enable Pakistan's small navy to strike targets on
land, complementing the sizable land-based missile arsenal that Pakistan has
developed. That, in turn, would be likely to spur another round of an arms race with
India that the United States has been trying, unsuccessfully, to halt. ""The focus of our
concern is that this is a potential unauthorized modification of a maritime antiship
defensive capability to an offensive land-attack missile,"" said another senior
administration official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
matter involves classified information.
""The potential for proliferation and end-use violations are things we watch very
closely,"" the official added. ""When we have concerns, we act aggressively.""
A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because the
interchanges with Washington have been both delicate and highly classified, said the
American accusation was ""incorrect."" The official said that the missile tested was
developed by Pakistan, just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of
land-based missiles that could strike India. He said that Pakistan had taken the
unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect the country's Harpoon
inventory to prove that it had not violated the law, a step that administration officials
praised.
Some experts are also skeptical of the American claims. Robert Hewson, editor of
Jane's Air Launched Weapons, a yearbook and Web-based data service, said the
Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land-attack missile, which
would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new
missile. Moreover, he said, Pakistan already has more modern land-attack missiles that
it developed itself or acquired from China.
""They're beyond the need to reverse-engineer old U.S. kit,"" Mr. Hewson said in a
telephone interview. ""They're more sophisticated than that."" Mr. Hewson said the ship-
to-shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted effort to develop an

array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air, land or sea to address
India's much more formidable conventional missile arsenal.
The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the United States and
a Pakistani military that American officials like to portray as an increasingly reliable
partner in the effort to root out the forces of the Taliban and Al Qaeda on Pakistani
territory. A central element of the American effort has been to get the military
refocused on the internal threat facing the country, rather than on threat the country
believes it still faces from India.
Pakistani officials have insisted that they are making that shift. But the evidence
continues to point to heavy investments in both nuclear and conventional weapons that
experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents.
Over the years, the United States has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to
Pakistan, including 37 of the older-model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to
1988, said Charles Taylor, a spokesman for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
The country's nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nation's. In May,
Pakistan conducted a test firing of its Babur medium-range cruise missile, a weapon
that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear warhead. The test
was conducted on May 6, during a visit to Washington by President Asif Ali Zardari,
but was not made public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had
ended to avoid upsetting the talks. While it may be technically possible to arm the
Harpoons with small nuclear weapons, outside experts say it would probably not be
necessary.
Before Congress departed for its summer recess, administration officials briefed crucial
legislators on the protest to Pakistan. The dispute has the potential to delay or possibly
even derail the legislation to provide Pakistan with $7.5 billion in civilian aid over five
years; lawmakers are scheduled to vote on the aid package when they return from their
recess next month.
The legislation is sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Richard G.
Lugar of Indiana, the top Democrat and Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, as well as Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who
leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressional aides are now reconciling
House and Senate versions of the legislation.

Frederick Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, declined to comment on the details of the
dispute citing its classified nature but suggested that the pending multifaceted aid bill
would clear Congress ""in a few weeks"" and would help cooperation between the two
countries.
""There have been irritants in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the past and there will
be in the future,"" Mr. Jones said in a statement, noting that the pending legislation
would provide President Obama ""with new tools to address troubling behavior.""

Biehi called a little after 1:30 pm to say the meeting with the de facto envoys had been abruptly cancelled -- but
for perhaps a positive reason.
Micheletti has asked about half the team to return to Tegucigalpa (Corrales stayed, as ""he seeks to confirm that
he will not lose his visa""). In the phone call he got from the de facto envoys as they headed for the airport,
Biehl said he detected a positive attitude. The envoys seemed confident they would get M to sign the SJ
Accord. The envoys prmoised to call Biehi late this afternoon with the news from Honduras. If, if, if, if, the
news is positive, Biehl and OAS Political Director Victor Rico will leave for Tegucigalpa tomorrow morning to
meet Micheletti, make sure this is not another time-wasting tactic, and get something in writing from him that
he agrees to the Accord and will sign it.
Just before speaking to me, Biehl had spoken with Arias who expressed cautious optimisim that we might have
a break-through. Arias told Biehl to tell us, that if that happens the United States gets the credit.
Arias said the US has played the game exactly right, with the appropriate mix of carrots, sticks, toughness,
unified message, even-handedness and, above all, good timing. Arias said the Europeans have been calling him
over the past two days, and have fallen into line with the US; the Swedes, as head of the EU, and have told him
that they will take their cue from the US and will support US actions. Arias, Biehi said, was extremely
complimentary of the ""great political instincts shown by Secretary Clinton.""

Hillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'
Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former
First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.
While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's
thoughts on a trade issue (""My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,"" she retorted), the emotional heart of her
tour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -
and what she will do about it.
What I Saw in Goma
By Hillary Rodham Clinton
In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.
The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent
conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal
militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe
haven.
Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever
glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their
homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.
Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has
become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an
average of 36 women and girls raped every day.
I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'
pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of
their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then
they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed
to get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.
I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and
abet them. They are crimes against humanity.
These acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us
together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.
But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.
We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health
care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded
in Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have
been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.
Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in
Bukavu, represent humanity at its best.
The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to
prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,
counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers
to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and
front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And
we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist
survivors of sexual violence.
While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the
perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important
when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit
these crimes with impunity.
Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not
end with my departure.
We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the
eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an
end to this conflict.
There is an old Congolese proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come."" The day must
come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and
collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are
strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their
country both peaceful and prosperous.
Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people
seize the opportunities of a new day.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764944 Date: 07/31/2015

tour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape
victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -
and what she will do about it.
What I Saw in Goma
By Hillary Rodham Clinton
In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.
The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a
provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent
conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal
militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe
haven.
Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever
glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their
homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.
Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has
become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an
average of 36 women and girls raped every day.
I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'
pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of
their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then
they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed
to get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764944 Date: 07/31/2015
I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and
abet them. They are crimes against humanity.
These acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us
together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.
But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.
We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health
care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded
in Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have
been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.
Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in
Bukavu, represent humanity at its best.
The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to
prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,
counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers
to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and
front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And
we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist
survivors of sexual violence.
While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the
perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important
when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit
these crimes with impunity.
Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not
end with my departure.
We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the
eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an
end to this conflict.
There is an old Congolese proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come."" The day must
come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and
collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are
strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their
country both peaceful and prosperous.
Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people
seize the opportunities of a new day.

Subject: Shannon & Valenzuela -- DeMint Staff Mtg
Cheryl,
Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.
With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.
Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.
We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.
DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.
Thanks.

Dear Melanne,
The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the
Egyptian candidate to UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him — for whatever reasons — this is acceptable as their choice, but
we think the US, with its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here am surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say ""We want to feel that
change is not just a Motto but starts a new era in our relationship""
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is
accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The allegation is based
on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored
Synagogues and is establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah
scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together in
Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental — Terrorists are against him and are the ones
7Torkilg hard to block his election.

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the Brandenburg
Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience
of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue
from past to future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the east
who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with
hammers and picks and bare hands is called ""Die Wende,"" a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning
point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the
wall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common history—and to our
common future.
Richard von Weizsaecker said, ""As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain open.""
Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is
open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the most
successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of American
foreign policy. And the German – American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015
reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it
must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a wall we
have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, ""Ich
bin ein Berliner."" Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening
of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire
world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the Gate as a
symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the French
Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a
symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And
then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of Berlin as though
freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of
freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their
dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as
an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after 1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to end in
peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of historical
events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to
history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that
transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. The
great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can
sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the
future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to run. Our
presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light
the torches of freedom throughout the world.

The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure
freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the
Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and
conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the
opportunity for people to support themselves and their families – without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and
violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within
them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of
heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of
the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples
gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men—
and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall
once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,
linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We
are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Re: Westerwelle

The following are notes of my conversation this morning with Wolfgang Ischinger (who will be at the Berlin
event tonight). You will of course recall Wolfgang as the former director of the German Foreign Ministry and
ambassador to the UK and US. He knows Westerwelle very well, Wolfgang's former staff is now mostly
Westerwelle's senior staff and he understands Westerwelle's personality.
Wolfgang Ischinger
11/08/09
The important thing about Guido Westerwelle is that he's spent his entire life in politics. He's scored a dramatic
success for a small party, which has traditionally scored 9 to 10 percent, but now at 15 percent. He wants to
translate this victory into a sustained role for the Free Democrats in the system. There's a lot of ambition there.
He has not spent any significant amount of time on foreign policy, not his area of expertise, but he's a quick
study. He's a fluent English speaker, not a conservative at all, advocated the idea of a nuclear free world,
embraced fully. That is one operational area where the US can expect a lot of support.
He will make a real effort to maintain and expand a meaningful relationship with Russia. I don't see any friction
at all with the US. He's a transatlanticist by nature and training.
One footnote: Westerwelle has argued during the campaign and in recent speeches that he wishes to promote a
process that would allow the remaining US weapons in Germany, holdovers form the Cold War, to be
eliminated. It's not an anti-US point, but a German way of saying we are in favor of nuclear disarmament. It
should not be seen as a hostile act, but a German contribution to a nuclear free world.
He lives with a partner who has a PR agency. He represents a new generation that doesn't mind same sex
partnership, symbolizes a new, more liberal society where the traditional taboos are no longer in existence. He's

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765340 Date: 07/31/2015
highly sensitive about it. He didn't come out of the closet for many years. There's a degree of vulnerability
behind it.
He's not a 'buddy"" guy, who slaps people on the back. It takes time to develop a trusting relationship with him.
It's more difficult for him than others. He's a careful person in terms of personal relationships.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher is considered a trademark in Germany of successful diplomacy in the last decade
before the end of the Cold War and the transition. (Genscher was foreign minsiter from 1974-92.) If you can say
Genscher is your mentor that is thought to be reassuring in Germany. Kohl is out of circulation. Schmidt is
retired. Genscher is really the only one. That Westerwelle refers to his relationship is reassuring given that
Guido is not a foreign policy specialist. Genscher's blessing is good for him. At the personal level, the
relationship was never intimate. It would not be correct to say Westerwelle is a Genscher creation. He made his
own career.
Westerwelle is going to rely to a great extent on staff members who earned their experience in the Genscher
days (and worked with Ischinger). The senior staff that will now be appointed at the foreign minister will be
excellent—a lot of pro-transatlantic people in the lineup.
This is good news for the bilateral relationship. It will be easier to work this German foreign ministry than was
the case with Steinmeier.
Westerwelle knows that the one relationship he must manage well is the one with Secretary clinton.
My advice is that she works with him closely, as closely as with any European foreign minister, that would be
very beneficial. If she can embrace him and make him look good that make will things go well.

Iran charges three detained Americans with espionage
(Adds background)
TEHRAN, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Iran has charged three detained U.S. citizens with espionage, the official IRNA news agency
quoted a judiciary official as saying on Monday. ""The three are charged with espionage. Investigations continue into the
three detained Americans in Iran,"" Tehran general prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said. The three were held after
they strayed into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July. The three, Shane Bauer, 27, Sarah Shourd, 31, and Josh
Fattal, 27, crossed into Iranian territory nearly two months ago. Their families say they strayed across the border
accidentally. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested in an interview with the American television network
NBC in September that the Americans' release might be linked to the release of Iranian diplomats he said were being
held by U.S. troops in Iraq. Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, espionage is punishable by death.

November 09, 2009
Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: ""There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow.""
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
""He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did,"" said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765646 Date: 07/31/2015
Mr. Black added: ""He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family.""
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an ""impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time.""
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

Huma: I was just typing one. Not surprisingly, the hardliner supporters of the regime, when they got wind of the deal
today, mounted a counterattack, urging M not to leave. We are pushing back as we speak, and our de facto sources
who support the deal are working to nail it down.
We are making the point that M's agreement to us to step aside fueled our successful efforts over last couple days to
keep Euros and many Latins in the game but they need a change on the ground to support elections. M cannot pull
rug out now. Moreover, we said since the de factos claim moral authority (over Zelaya) for carrying out the Oct 30
Accord, they cannot go back on this deal with us.
Will give you updates. I have an open ticket to go back down at any moment if necessary. Will let you know if an S call
would help.

Amateur Hour at the White House
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm
The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his
foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.
President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's
limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of
the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama
should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in
decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.
Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's
most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism
and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade
problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.
A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized
Obama for not getting China to ""throw its weight around."" What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others
lamented that Obama couldn't make ""demands"" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and
that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,
and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama
continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach
this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and
alienating America's allies.
Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect ""deliverables""
on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-
operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when
you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to
make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on
certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents
wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the
visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for
Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.
Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and
the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways
to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would
actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North
Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-
deserved vacation in Hawaii.
Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do
this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate
that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and
meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders
obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he
and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.
The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic
economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But

see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have
advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the
God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral
organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian
Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are
increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian
nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China
won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want
Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a
leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.
They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.
That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its
leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like
the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the
new Pacific Era.

I want to thank all three of you for the tremendous support you have given me and WHA since the beginning of the
Obama Administration. I am especially grateful to the Secretary for the confidence she has shown in me, and her
willingness to make me part of her team. I consider this an enormous honor and I hope that I have met her
expectations. I look forward to continuing to be part of her team from Brazil.
I am preparing a ""Last Thoughts"" paper for the Secretary, which will look back over the past ten months, identify
accomplishments, and point toward what I think needs to come next. I will share this paper with Arturo.
Regarding Honduras, Craig did heroic work there this week, and we are moving toward a potentially big step by
Micheletti that would open space for many of our allies to support the elections. As we move forward, it is important to
note that the solution to the crisis is becoming more and more Honduran with each step in the process. This is a good
thing, because it increases the chances that the resolution will be peaceful, enduring, and a platform for the political
reforms that must come next.
It is worth highlighting that the Secretary, through her outreach to both sides and her clear commitment to the future of
Honduran democracy, has positioned us as an honest broker in this dispute. The only honest broker. Everyone one else
in this drama -- from Insulza to the Brazilians to the Albinos -- has other agendas and motives in play. In this regard, we
are the only hope of the Honduran people. The internal dialogue taking place, within the de facto regime, among its
supporters, and between the Micheletti and Zelaya camps, is the product of our engagement. No one else could have
done this. I urge that you keep this in mind as we move forward and as we consider how we will support the November
29 elections.
Finally, I leave behind a great Bureau. I believe it is the best in the State Department. Craig and the other DASes are
superb, and I believe we have an extraordinary cadre of Ambassadors. This is a huge resource for the Secretary and the
President. Use it.
Again, my deepest thanks to you and the Secretary.

I appreciate being included in the dialogue last evening. I now have a much better appreciation for the challenges, as
well as the pressures you and the Secretary address each day. While I suspect there is not much that those of us on the
""outside"" can do to help, call on me at any time if I can assist in any fashion. Not to be too dramatic about it but the
Secretary's success is in the country's interests. Reference was made last night to more rest for HRC-I have to believe
that with the rigors of your job a little R+R for you is in order-hopefully you can work out some personal time over the
holiday period.
By the way, can you give me an email for Capricia Marshall?
All the best and do call if there is anything I can do.

Subject: for S -- a stunning fact
The Quadrennial ""America's Place in the World"" survey conducted both generally among the
American public and among Council on Foreign Relations members found that ""a plurality
of the (American) public now says that China, not the United States, is the world's leading
economic power. Currently, 44% of the public says China is the world's leading economic
power, while just 27% name the United States. As recently as the beginning of last year, 41%
said the U.S. was the top economic power while 3 0 % said China."" On the brighter side,
'Despite widespread anxiety over the economy, public support for free trade agreements has
increased since 2008. A modest plurality now sees free trade agreements as good for the
U.S.; in April 2008, a plurality said such agreements were bad for the country."" The two
sentiments may well be related, of course.

Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles
of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.
Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-
century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide
range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has
changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most
pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after
report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to
respond to the new 21st-century paradigm.
But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and
reassign the pieces?
There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its ""core missions"" of
traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found
that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a
bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,
the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including
""today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,"" the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the
Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership
in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers
capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.
By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on
Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department
now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for
example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State
Department's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs.
Further, rivalries between the different ""cones"" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the ""conal caste system""
-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau
noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a ""failed office"" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.
Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership ""does not understand public diplomacy."" The sentiment is
widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,
described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional
discrimination against those in the career track.
Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human
and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its
bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike
Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is
so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If
there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean
it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.
The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such
luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the ""expanding
role of the military in U.S. foreign policy."" He said he was concerned by the ""migration of functions and authorities from
U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense.""
Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy
it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public
diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --
could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.
But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.
The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the
U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.
Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one
hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This ""Department of State
and Non-State"" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and
upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid
hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.
Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow
authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries
and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to
oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the
regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.
Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would
help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense
Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regional
leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These
changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for
today's requirements.
But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a
bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growing
power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more
importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.
In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for the
State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight
years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed
cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and
implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The
United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president
whose entire election platform was built around the word ""change,"" and an American public that would be outraged at
the dysfunction if it only knew the details.

Flew into Santo Domingo last night. Went overland to PaP. With Amb. Merten in Haiti.
About to do an aerial tour w/Amb. Planning on going out with S. Florida search and response teams. (Was former State
trooper so we think he has some experience in search and rescue, but cannot know for sure.) He's doing this on his
own, so we're not sure what he's planning.
His staff had been trying to persuade him not to travel for at least the immediate future, but it clearly didn't work. He
has received too many phone calls from constituents encouraging him to go.
Contacts in his office:
Clarence Williams, Chief of Staff
Hassan Christian,

Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766102 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766102 Date: 07/31/2015
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.
It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal
life over the time period of the suspension.
Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens
will also be provided during this time.
Regarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our
sovereign capital.
As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all
the city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike.
When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to
construction.
I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace
process forward. There is no more time to waste.
Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.

Congress earmarked 2.5 mil dollars for democracy stuff in Libya. Not an Admin request. Requirement to work through

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office
Phone: 202.224.6221
Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to ""live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success."" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces ""is our goal.""
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""
But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.""
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015

Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to ""live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success."" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces ""is our goal.""
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.

While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""
But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.""
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the

Africa's Anti-Gay Laws Spark Accusations and Denials in US
Nico Colombant I Washington 21 December 2009
Photo: AP
Evangelical pastor Rick Warren, 23 Jun 2009
Anti-gay laws sweeping through East Africa have sparked a debate in the United States about the possible influence of
American evangelical leaders and lawmakers with strong ties in that region. U.S. activists are also shedding new light on
the risks that gays face in East Africa.
In his book called The Family, American journalist Jeff Sharlet criticizes a group of influential American Christian leaders
and conservative lawmakers with close ties to politicians in East Africa.
He accuses them of treating some of the countries they deal with as social and political experiments.
""It has become sort of a Frankenstein's monster and is the family going to take responsibility for the empowerment they
have given to some of these politicians?,"" asked Jeff Sharlet.
In his book, Sharlet specifically refers to politicians in Uganda proposing an anti-gay law that would criminalize
homosexuality. The law, which could be passed within weeks despite international condemnation, includes possible
punishment by death.
Anti-gay laws were recently passed in Burundi, are being discussed in Rwanda, and could soon be expanded in Kenya
and Tanzania.
The American group Sharlet calls The Family is also known as The Fellowship. It organizes an annual National Prayer
Breakfast with the U.S. president and foreign guests, but besides that activity shuns publicity and does not openly list its
members.
But Sharlet says more American reporters are looking into the group and its alleged ties to Africa. These include helping
African politicians with money so they can push socially conservative agendas.
""We see reporters in Iowa, in Pennsylvania, and in Oklahoma, going to their elected representatives who have a link to
this whole thing and saying 'tell us about the link',"" he said. ""They are not accusing them of anything, they are saying,
'You have a relationship with the Ugandan government, what is the nature of that relationship? And, are you going to
use that influence to oppose this legislation that seems to be supported by some of your allies?""
Religious leaders like Rick Warren have also been under the microscope. He is the senior pastor of the California-based
Saddleback church, which is active in both Uganda and Rwanda.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766391 Date: 08/31/2015
After being questioned about his role by U.S. media, Warren issued a video message on the Internet, denying his
support for the law in Uganda.
""As an American pastor, it is not my role to interfere with the politics of other nations, but it is my role to speak out on
moral issues and it is my role to shepherd other pastors who look to me for guidance, and it is my role to correct lies and
errors and false reports when others associate my name with a law that I had nothing to do with, [and which] I
completely oppose and I vigorously condemn,"" said Rick Warren. ""I am referring to the pending law under consideration
by the Ugandan parliament, known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill.""
Rwanda's parliament is also working to pass a law which would criminalize homosexuality but Warren has yet to address
his church's role in that matter. In 2005, he called Rwanda a ""purpose driven nation."" Warren went with dozens of
American evangelicals to hold meetings with government ministers, lawmakers and donate materials to churches across
Rwanda.
Several American lawmakers who have been linked to the Fellowship, like Nevada Senator John Ensign have called the
Ugandan law proposal ""outrageous"". But others like Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, who went to Uganda in 2004,
have said they do not know enough about the bill to comment.
The executive director of the U.S.-based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, Cary Alan Johnson,
welcomes some of the questions now being asked.
""It is a debate that has to happen and we are glad it is happening,"" said Cary Alan Johnson. ""Rwanda and Uganda are
both countries with deeply spiritual people and as of late we have understood that some of the more conservative
elements in the United States have been funding the most violent and homophobic discourses about homosexuality.""
Johnson says those seeking to push an agenda should understand the consequences of their actions. He warns anti-gay
laws could worsen already high HIV levels in east Africa.
""The impact of these laws on HIV prevention is extremely worrisome to us,"" he said. ""Laws we are talking about in
Uganda, Rwanda, will make it impossible for groups to do HIV education that targets men who have sex with men or
that targets bisexual people and we know that there is a strong impact of HIV on this community and on society in
general.""
Lisa Laurel Weinberg, from the Massachusetts Lutheran Social Services Human Rights Protection Project, says the
situation is already very difficult. In her other job as an asylum attorney, she recently helped a young Ugandan woman
win asylum to the United States. The woman's apartment had been raided by police while she was inside with her
girlfriend.
""The police broke in and brought them to the police station and raped them in what is called a corrective rape,"" said Lisa
Laurel Weinberg. ""It is when males of authority try and correct lesbianism through rape.""
But Weinberg warns trying to fight the new laws from the outside is very complicated.
""I got an e-mail yesterday that said be really careful and check with Ugandans before you do any advocacy from the
West, because us imposing our values, they are really sensitive to the whole colonialism history, so that the email
cautioned be careful what you do and let it come from them,"" she said.
Some prominent politicians and journalists in East Africa have called homosexuality the ""white man's disease."" Pro-gay
groups in the region, which are mostly underground, say they are becoming increasingly afraid to ask for help, and
believe outside interference could worsen the persecution they face.

Re: Tony Blair, EU presidency, Tory Party, & Berlin trip
One of your agenda items behind the scenes on your Berlin trip can be to discuss the future of the EU, the
European presidency and the prospects of Tony Blair. If Blair does not become EU president the position will
likely be filled by a third rank nonentity in the Brussels bureaucratic mode incapable of realizing the
possibilities in the creation of the office, continuing the feebleness of Europe as a political idea and reality. Of
course, it is in the US interest to have a strong Europe—and the naming of the first European president might be
the most important opportunity for the US to strengthen Europe, to give it actual sinew, for a long time and a
long time to come.
The Conservative Party is split over Europe and Blair. Hague represents the Tory right, which is the center of
the party. He is supported prominently by Boris Johnson, mayor of London, also known as the Tory ""clown
prince."" The responsible wing, such as Chris Patten, the former European Commissioner, and Douglas Hurd,
former Foreign Secretary, are pro-European and not necessarily hostile to having Blair there as a counter-weight
to the anti-Europeans of their own government, helping to tilt things more their way. All present themselves as
""pro-American,"" sine qua non of Conservative rhetoric, though there is a nasty anti-American undercurrent on
the Tory right. Hague tried to paper this over in his conference with you and was disingenuous about the nature
of the far right parties the Tories are aligned with in Europe. Nobody in the UK or Europe is fooled.
Cameron is trying to balance the wings of the Conservative Party. On domestic policy, he is more radical than
his Etonian image suggests (profound connotations of the Conservative paternalistic, aristocratic one-nation
tradition), more influenced by the Thatcher legacy, more like George W. Bush influenced by Reagan and
Reaganism than by his father and vestigial moderate Republicanism. On foreign policy, Cameron is unsure,
inexperienced, oblique, and largely uncommitted. So far his foreign policy is little more than projection of his
domestic politics, especially his need to keep his party behind him going into the election. His political

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya""s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for

opportunity to promote that vital mission.

Hi Huma — could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the
letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the
GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it
is still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which

challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the
Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final
conclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.
Embassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.

Brasil. According to the 2'd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the
U.S. on an overnight flight.
Damour will continue to update as events progress.

Dan,
I just got off the phone with Embassy Brasilia Charge Lisa Kubiske, who provided a recap of current developments in the
Goldman child custody case. Summarizing:
-- David Goldman's Brazilian lawyer and the family's attorney are currently attempting to negotiate an ""voluntary
return.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766651 Date: 08/31/2015
--If those talks fail, Goldman will request the Brazilian police execute the involuntary return ordered yesterday by a
Brazilian judge. This outcome would create a negative PR climate.
--Brazilian police ""think"" they know the boy's whereabouts.
--Return to US likely will occur on an NBC News-chartered aircraft, as Goldman has inked some sort of exclusive deal w/
NBC for the story.
--Post has been working with WHA and PD on a possible S statement.
Craig Kelly just called in for the latest developments, which I passed. gm

Ms. Damour,
Do you have any updated information to report? As you could imagine, there is significant high-level interest in the
Department on the Goldman case, and I am hoping to brief the Executive Secretary with the latest developments at

Importance: High
I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
o Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police
and judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take
custody of Sean.
o Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
o David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at STJ will not be accepted
by the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but
he seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this
changes.
Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the
moment, but please do not hesitate to call.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time
Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
• The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
• We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here
generally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring
of Sean's whereabouts.
• We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an ""immediate"" return order — it could mean right this
instant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at
the Consulate or some other site.
• We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served
getting some rest now and starting first thing 008 which for us means 7-8am.
• We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee
receiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover
there. This is a scenario we've planned for.

BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that
issue. As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to
hear the motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.

If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Importance: High
Here is what we know:
• STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
• The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
• The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to
move. HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio
that would generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
• Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first

instance is on recess and the ""duty court"" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware
of the status of the case and may be prepared to move this evening.
• BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
happen tomorrow morning.
What we don't know:
• No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the
Brazilian family.
• No details as yet on what, if anything the Brazilian family has done in response to the news from STF.
Embassy staff are in the room with David's Brazilian attorney and will report just as soon as we have any details to
offer. Please advise me if you have any specific questions we need to pose to the team.

As Haiti recovers, give children special attention
*By Irwin Redlener*
Given the extraordinary destruction wrought by last month's earthquake
in Haiti, few will be surprised if this catastrophe is recorded as one
of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history. But what is not
well appreciated is that this disaster could disproportionately impact
children, not only those who perished in the initial shocks, but also
those who will not survive what is likely to be a cruel aftermath.
*Photo gallery:*
<http://mediagallery.usatoday.com/A-long-journey-out-of-Haiti-/G1436> As
Haiti struggled to pull itself together in the days immediately
following the 7.0 earthquake that hit the island nation, one Iowa family
was waiting to hear whether the child they had pledged to adopt three
years ago was still alive.
Before the quake, many of the 380,000 children living in shelters
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-01-24-haiti-children_N.htm>
were placed there out of economic desperation; families could not afford
to care for them. Now, many more children displaced by the earthquake
will literally have no surviving family members, further swelling demand
on social service agencies throughout the country.
*Kids at risk*
As the U.S. and other countries make plans to help Haiti get back on its
feet, emphasis should be on enhancing that nation's resiliency — and
that will mean dealing with the needs of- its children. The unusual
extent of child casualties will be driven by several factors:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766861 Date: 08/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766861 Date: 08/31/2015
• About 50% of the Haitian population of 9 million is younger than 18
<http://www.uniceforg/emerg/haiti_52590.html>. Even more striking is
the fact that children 14 years of age and less make up more than 38%.
• Everything about a natural disaster puts children at greater risk. A
comparatively small chunk of dislodged ceiling would injure an adult,
but it might well kill an infant or small child. Water deprivation will
lead far more rapidly to dehydration and shock in an infant than it
would in an adult.
• Some seriously injured children have survived the initial trauma
because they were among the few to get surgical attention provided by
international medical teams. But access to follow-up care could be an
overwhelming challenge. Compounding concerns, the Ministry of Health at
one point asked physicians not to provide medical care
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-01-27-1Acomfort27_CV_N.htm>
that can't be sustained in Haiti.
*Long-term needs*
Between 1 million to 2 million Haitians will be ""displaced"" for the
foreseeable future. This means a minimum of 400,000 to 800,000 children
will be in temporary shelter for months or years. But the rainy season
is coming in May, followed by hurricane season in June. Families in
tents or other flimsy shelters will be at grave risk.
• What about the psychological impact? Grieving over loss and trauma
carries the potential of long-term consequences for every Haitian,
especially the countless children.
Then there are Haiti's chronic problems that must be addressed head-on.
For decades, Haitians have experienced a seemingly intractable state of
poverty, accompanied by malnutrition and high rates of acute and chronic
illness. More than 50% of Haitians live on less than a dollar a day, and
. more than 60% of its young children have nutritional anemia.
Despite the efforts of international agencies and non-governmental
organizations, chronic illness abounds and access to clean water,
medical care and sanitation remains a significant challenge for
Haitians, particularly children.
This is why the recovery and rebuilding of this fragile nation must
begin and end with a central focus on the immediate and long-term needs
of children. If there is to be a glimmer of hope for Haiti, it will be
because the international community understands that the capacity to
rise from the ashes of catastrophe is directly related to the health,
well-being and potential of its youngest generation.

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.
Warm regards,
Michele

1 e NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the
senior administration official as limiting military operations ""in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two
goals -- to prevent al-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government."" The use of resource-
intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to

Civilian, military planners have different views on new
approach to Afghanistan
By Rajiv Chandrasekaran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01
Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal's request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.
Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told
McChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than
half that number by next October.
Ten days after Obama's speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the
combined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal's goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.
""It's an open issue,"" a senior Pentagon official said last week.
Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with
differing views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, according to more than a dozen senior
administration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss internal deliberations.
Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and
whether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war.
The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White
House and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.
The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date
by seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration
official said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department
activities in Afghanistan to prevent ""overreaching.""
The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the
senior administration official as limiting military operations ""in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two
goals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government."" The use of resource-
intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to
be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.
""The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,"" Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,
using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. ""This is not 'go out and occupy the whole country.' ""
Setting limits
During a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.
Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White
House Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to
Afghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.
Obama's essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, ""Don't bite off more than you can chew.""
White House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style
counterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in
Afghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White House's
desired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-
capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.
Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the
administration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon
strategists and McChrystal's advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less
extensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come
to be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.
Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing
troops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the
approach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by
trying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training
local security forces.
McChrystal's plan, the senior Pentagon official said, ""is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people
are trying to spin.""
Dissent over drawdown
During strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp
relief over °baffle's decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011.
McChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central
Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to
make the drawdoWn ""conditions-based.""
""There was a lot of push back"" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.
The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that
resonated with Obama and Biden.
Cartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited
counterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, ""but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai
government, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is
not prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this.""
It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that
McChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department
paperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed
by the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.
""Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president's intervention was to say, 'Okay, if we're starting in July
of '09, then we're really talking about July of '11,"" said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.
Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals
would be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough
review of progress in a year's time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal's request to increase the Afghan security
forces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.
The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain
the specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" the
Sunday after the speech, said that perhaps only ""some handful or some small number"" would be withdrawn. Biden, during
his MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be ""coming
down as rapidly over the next two years.""
The ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. ""Is the
surge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?"" asked a senior
Democratic staff member in Congress. ""Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows.""
One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers ""don't know if this is all over in 18 months, or
whether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes.""
""Until they tell us otherwise,"" the officer said, ""we're operating as if the latter is the policy.""
A 'dramatic change'?
Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been
circumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House
has embraced McChrystal's original plan.
""We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn't try to clear and hold things more than we needed to,"" said a senior
commander involved in the war. ""It wasn't a dramatic change by any means.""
White House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a
slide stating that his mission was to ""Defeat the Taliban,"" which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it
suggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was
redefined to avoid the term.
But to military officers, defeat ""doesn't mean wipe everyone out,"" the commander said. ""It means after Waterloo,
Napoleon still had an army but he wasn't going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat.""
Even before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.
Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country's nearly 400 districts.
""They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus,"" a senior
military official said.
White House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over
the summer.
""There was a real narrowing here,"" the senior administration official said. ""Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his
original concept to the new strategic guidance.""
The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. ""This doesn't turn
around with a speech,"" the official said. ""But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that our
goal is 400,000"" Afghan security forces.
The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next
18 months in accordance with the new goal.
""The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever,"" the second official said. ""The
hardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough.""
For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers.
""Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country,"" the senior Pentagon official said. ""We've
separated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy.
It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them.""
Terms such as ""winning"" and ""victory"" have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1
address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term ""victory"" when fighting ""a
non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda.""
But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama's speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that ""we
are in this thing to win.""
""From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win,"" the Pentagon official said.
""We need to be able to articulate winning.""</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766890 Date: 08/31/2015

That would be more than fine. I appreciate you even looking to see if this may work.
On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. I know
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes
you and said if I were to be in contact with you to say hi from him.
Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.
All my best,

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mendelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mendelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mendelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mendelson to be appointed foreign

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mendelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mendelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mendelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.
One more item: Did you read Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post today? He nails McDonough for trashing Biden,
among other things. Enclosed below story on Chilcot:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair
Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth fl Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/pclitics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein; bypassing the ""official channels"" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves -
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. ""We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents.""
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. ""I don't think it invalidated the point about the programMes he had. It was more about use,"" he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. ""I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?"" Meyer asked. ""I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. ""We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. ""
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: ""I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that.""
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: ""I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK.""
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry cut an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received ""new instructions"" in early 2005 indicating that it was a ""complete waste of time"" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were ""voices"" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action ""to bring about regime change"".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as ""scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida"" — a connection that was ""so far, frankly unconvincing"". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during, the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly

controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.
The Washington Post
Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagland
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
I am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a ""NATO surge"" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the ""floor"" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiiing.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
""Say it now, pay it later,"" we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the ""civilian surge"" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Haitian activists want Obama to address immigration
goals
With President Barack Obama coming to Miami, some Haitian-American activists want
him to address the issue of Temporary Protected Status.
BY LESLEY CLARK AND JACQUELINE CHARLES
LCLARK@MIAMIHERALD.COM
WASHINGTON -- Haitian-American and immigrant activists who greeted President Barack Obama's election with
high hopes are growing frustrated with the administration's failure to deliver one of their top goals.
Obama said in July he was ""very sympathetic"" to the community's request to allow Haitian immigrants now illegally
in the country to stay temporarily, but no decision has been announced. Some activists say their patience is wearing
thin.
""I feel they are stringing us along, and we are in an awkward position,"" said Randolph McGrorty, head of Catholic
Charities Legal Services, who brought the subject to a head with a stinging e-mail sent to House, Senate and
administration staffers last week. ""Do we allow them to string us along because they are our allies or do we start
calling them on the carpet for it?""
The unrest comes as Obama plans a trip to Miami on Monday to raise money for House and Senate Democrats.
Presidential candidate Obama did not promise to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants temporary legal status in
the United States -- a designation known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS -- but activists said they believed
the first African-American president would give the issue special consideration.
Instead, former President Bill Clinton -- a United Nations special envoy to the country -- and the United Nations have
taken the lead in rebuilding a storm-battered Haiti after last year's four back-to-back storms that killed hundreds and
left nearly $1 billion in damages.
CHALLENGE
The issue of TPS poses a challenge for Rep. Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat who is depending on a robust
tumout in the politically active Haitian-American community to boost his Senate bid. But critics say South Florida's
congressional Democrats, including Meek, have not been as vocal about pushing the Obama administration on Haiti
as they were during the Bush administration.
Meek, who represents the largest group of Haitian-American voters in the United States, said Friday he's had
meetings with the administration and is optimistic that it is taking a serious look at the policy.

It may not come as soon as we want to, but I can tell you the Obama administration has made steps the Bush
administration wouldn't have made in 100 years,"" Meek said, noting that the administration has temporarily stayed
deportations of noncriminals to Haiti. ""The ultimate goal is to have Haiti in a position where Haitians can stay in
Haiti and not take to the sea.""
Still, Broward Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings chastised the administration last week, looking to prod it by attaching
an amendment to a Coast Guard spending bill that would require the agency to review the effect of changing
immigration policy toward Haiti. Critics have suggested TPS could lead Haitians to rush to the U.S. shore.
""Temporary Protected Status or some other comparable relief for our Haitian neighbors is long overdue and this
administration has been stalling for far too long,"" Hastings said in support of his amendment.
He said the review would ""hopefully help us show that our government has rationally and realistically examined all
possible scenarios and we are well-equipped to contend with any possible effects.""
U.S. POLICY
When Obama brought up the issue in July, he said the administration is reviewing U.S. policy on deporting
undocumented Haitians, suggesting that the issue would be ""part of a broader conversation about immigration.""
But immigration groups say the pace on overhauling the nation's immigration system is too slow and fear no
progress next year during a volatile election.
The White House this week referred questions on TPS to the Department of Homeland Security, which said it had
made no changes in policy, adding that, ""no one should attempt to come to the U.S. in the hopes of being granted
TPS.
Advocates for Haitian Americans, including Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy
Center, said they've written a number of letters and e-mails to the administration seeking a response to their request
for TPS -- and in recent months have offered less-sweeping alternatives to TPS to help the estimated 35,000
undocumented Haitians currently living in legal limbo.
""Washington needs to know we are not going to fade into the woodwork,"" Little said. ""We are going to continue to
make the case for TPS and be critical of this administration when they don't do the right thing.""
ADVOCATE
Earlier this month, Little appealed to former President Clinton who, during two appearances in Miami recently, spoke
of his support for TPS. He said if the decision was up to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ""it would have been
done. Hillary strongly supports this.""
A spokesman for the State Department declined to comment on Clinton's remarks, saying they were the former
president's ""personal comments"" and it would be ""inappropriate for us to make any official declarations on the
issue"" since the decisions are being made by Homeland Security.
Advocates acknowledge the administration has quietly made some changes. It has temporarily suspended the
deportation of noncriminal, undocumented Haitians. Undocumented Haitians with no criminal records who are
detained by immigration authorities are being released from detention centers as long as they agree to a final order
of removal.
Once released, they can apply for work permits but must periodically check in with immigration authorities until they
are eventually deported.
'BABY STEPS'

But critics dismiss the changes as ""baby steps,"" noting that by not granting undetained migrants a chance to apply
for work permits, they're unable to support themselves or assist struggling families back home. An impoverished
Haiti is dependent on remittances from abroad.
""That is not nearly enough,"" Little said. ""That is not even a half-hearted attempt at doing the right thing here.""
The Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition met Wednesday to discuss the issue and plans to protest at Obama's
fundraiser in Miami on Monday. Haitian activists protested outside the White House last month.
""As far as we are concerned, regarding Haiti, the Obama administration is maintaining the same status quo as the
Bush immigration policy,"" said Jean-Robert Lafortune, the coalition's president.

Subject: Haiti judge rules for release of U.S. missionaries
By Joseph Guyler Delva
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A Haitian judge said Thursday he had ruled in favor of the release of 10
U.S. missionaries accused of kidnapping 33 children and trying to take them out of the earthquake-stricken
country.
""I just signed the request for the release of the 10 Americans submitted by the lawyers and I have sent it to
the prosecutor's office,"" Judge Bernard Sainvil said.
He earlier told Reuters that once the prosecutor had given his opinion, he could formally issue a release order
for the Americans, who have been jailed since they were stopped at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic
on Jan. 29.
Once the release order was issued, ""they can go directly to the airport if they want and leave, but they should
provide a guarantee of representation if further questions need to be asked,"" Sainvil said.
Under Haitian law, the prosecutor can formally comment on the judge's decision but he cannot overrule it.
A judicial source told Reuters Wednesday that Sainvil had decided to free the U.S. missionaries because
there had been no evidence demonstrating ""criminal intentions"" on their part to support charges of child kidnap
and criminal association leveled against them.
The missionaries, most of whom belong to an Idaho-based Baptist church, were arrested trying to take the
children across the border to the Dominican Republic 17 days after a magnitude 7 earthquake that killed more
than 200,000 people in the impoverished Caribbean nation.
PLEAS FOR RELEASE FROM PARENTS
The five men and five women have denied any intentional wrongdoing and said they were only trying to
help orphans left destitute by the quake, which shattered the Haitian capital and left more than 1 million
homeless. But evidence showed that most of the children still had living parents.
During hearings in the case, Sainvil heard from 10 parents of children handed over to the Americans. They

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767115 Date: 08/31/2015
said they had turned them over because they had no food or water to give them, and believed they would have a
better life with the missionaries elsewhere.
These parents had pleaded for the Americans' release.
The case has been a distraction to the Haitian government as it tries to cope with the aftermath of the
earthquake and was diplomatically sensitive for the United States as it heads a massive international effort to
feed and shelter Haitian quake survivors.
The U.S. government had said it was providing the Americans with consular access and monitoring their
case, but made clear it did not want to interfere.
Haiti's beleaguered government had warned that traffickers could try to take advantage of the chaos that
followed the quake by taking away vulnerable children, and it tightened adoption procedures.

Re: Saudi Arabia
I have been in contact with Chas Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and he has sent me his most
recent public speech on the subject. He says the policy part is toward the end, and that King Abdullah's new
university (KAUST) is an important initiative. He also relates that the atmosphere is near toxic because of
Obama's failure to follow up his Cairo speech and the rebuff from Netanyahu. Cynicism, at best, is pervasive
among the Saudi elite.
Saudi Arabia: The End of Progress without Change
Remarks to the Sarasota Institute for Lifetime Learning
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
Sarasota, Florida, February 11, 2010
I have been asked to speak to you about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a topic I have never before
addressed to an American audience. Why bother?
We Americans reserve the right to have strong opinions on the basis of little or no knowledge. There are few
countries that better exemplify our assertive ignorance of foreign geography, history, and culture than Saudi
Arabia. Most of us are convinced that Saudis are Muslim zealots, control the world's oil prices, and are
absurdly rich, anti-feminist, and undemocratic. They hate our values and want to destroy us. Talk radio
confirms this. What more needs to be said?

On reflection, a lot does. Neither caricature nor a priori reasoning is a sound basis for policy. A distorted view
of foreign realities precludes success at dealing with them. There is much at stake in our relationship with
Saudi Arabia. We can ill afford to get it wrong.
That country is, of course, the heartland of Islam and the custodian of the world's largest oil reserves. It lies
athwart transport routes between Asia, Europe, and A.frica. It is at the center of a. growing concentration of
global capital. tinder any circumstances, the .Kingdom of Saudi Arabia NV cut important. It is all the more
so in an era when we Americans are at war with ever more peoples in the Islamic world, depend on ever greater
amounts of imported energy, and need ever larger foreign loans to Mil our government and sustain our life
style.
Yet Saudi Arabia is little known.. It is the only society on the planet not to have been penetrated by Western
colonialism. No European armies breached its borders; no missionaries; no merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, was
long off limits to infidels; the holy cities of Mecca and Medini. remain so to;:lay. 'When Westeriaers finally came
to Saudi Arabia, we came not as the vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. As a
result, some say that Saudis secretly see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow
Saudis; and (2) potentitA employees. 'Be that as it may, foreigners, Western, Asian, or /krab, who have lived in
SLiudi Arabi.a all see it as a -very strange place — one that is riot easy to itnclerstand and that remains at odds with
many of the values non-Saudis profess.
The Kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. Its system of government draws on tribal and Islamic
traditions rather than Western models. Its king presides rather than rules over the royal family and Saudi
society. His responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and proclaim consensus, while assuring a
share of the national wealth to all. especially the leas;. 1ri.A.7ilege(. Saudi Arabia levies no taxes 011 t S citizens,
other than the religious tithe known as ""zakat"" a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to
charity and oilier public purposes. All Saudis ,njoy free education and Medi cal care fro PiTi rth to cleath and can
pursue these sen, ices at home of abroad.. as they wish. The Kingdom has no parliament. though it does have
elaborate informal mechanisms for consultation with its citizens on policy matters. Saudi Arabia reverses and
thereby affirms a basic principle of American political philosophy. ""No representation without taxation.""
Unlike some other countries in the Arab Gulf, Saudi .Nra.bia has invested its oil wealth at home, not abroad,
ii it
it ilaS long been generous v,fith foreign aid. (At one point it was donatin.g six 13:fa-cent of GDP to other,
mostly Muslim, nations.) The desecrate poverty of the pre-oil period is now, at most, a dim memory. Over the
lifetime of elderly Sa.udis, the Kingdom's oer caraa. ifiC0111 e has risen about one hundred fold. Sparsely
populated mud-walled villages have grown into huge air-conditioned. cities with 21 Century
architecture. Today. Saudis are not just literate: many have university degrees. There are more U.S. Ph.D.'s in
the Saudi Cabinet than in our Cabinet and Conpress put together.
Despite rapid development, the strong family structure that characterized traditional Saadi society has remained
largely intact. II is truly rnoving to see how lovingly inn ha' and grandchildren care for their elders in the
Kingdom. Saudi Arabia's unique social stability is reflected in the flirt that almost none of its citizens emigrate,
though many have second homes abroad, and. a few. like Osama Biniadin, have been exiled for deviant
behavior.
for a long time it was easier for journalists and academics to get a visa to Tibet than to Saudi Arabia. Perhaps
this accounts for the near total lack of institutions and scholars that study the place. In the United States, q/1.1
v\fas followed by an avalanche of polemical tracts, but there are still very few books about the Kingdom that
reflect its realities rather than the authors' biases or propagandistic agendas. Lack of personal familiarity with
the Kingdom helps explain the repeated prediction by pundits that the Saudi monarchy is in
jeopardy. Generations of such pundits have passed away. The Kingdom has not. When I was ambassador to
Riyadh. I was so struck by the apparent social stasis that I briefly thought the national motto should be

""progress without change."" But in fact change is a constant in Saudi Arabia. Most of it comes from the top
down.
Not all Saudis are happy with the status quo. Some are angry about the extent to which the Kingdom is opening
up and reforming. Others are impatient to get on with reform. The ranks of the latter clearly include King
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Sa'ud, the current ruler. Now in his late eighties and on the throne only since 2005,
he has surprised everyone with the vigor of his efforts to modernize Saudi society and to reshape its
relationships with the world beyond its borders. Saudi Arabia has plenty of problems to keep the king engaged.
A lot of issues derive from the peculiar religious heritage of the Saudi state, The current Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia (now over a century old) is the third political structure to ally the House of Sa'ud with the family of the
eighteenth century religious reformer Shaykh al Islam Mohammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Al-Tanaimi. Ibn 'Abd
al-Wahhab's writings form the doctrinal basis of so-called Wahliabis-m, a notoriously intolerant and socially
conservative form of Islam -that is often confused with other reactionary religious traditions like that of the
Taliban. Saudi history has Mvolved a sustained efibrt by the Kingdom's rulers to persuade us religious scholars
and their puritanical followers to embrace change and to open up to the outside world. This struggle has mainly
been peaceful and virtually invisible to outsiders. Sometimes, however, it has engendered violence. In 1975,
for example, .the late King Faisal paid with his life for instituting public education for 2fris and for introducing
television to his nation.
Both as -regent (from 1996 to 2005) and more recently as ruler, King Abdullah has been so careful to avoid
drama in his promotion of change that it is truly startling to review the cumulative results of his
leadership. Take women's issues, for example. In 2002, responsibility for girls' education was transferred from
the religious authorities to the ministry of education. Women now make up 58 percent of the enrollment in
Saudi universities. The new Princess Noun ii 'Pint Abduirahmari University for Women, currently Wider
construction in Riyadh, will enroll 40,000 students this fall.
Female participation in the labor force is rising rapidly. Twenty-nine percent of women now work outside the
home. (That is a low figure compared to our own but represents a remarkable advance for the Kingdom.) One-
-third of civil service positions have !peen reserved -for women. The first woman took her seat i.n the Co modof
Ministers hist year. After a bit cilia kerfuffie, the .I',.iingdom's religious scholars ifinally endorsed coeducation at
the new King Abdullah Univershv for Science and Technology. That was big blow to the 'legitimacy of gender
apartheid. A Saudi friend and I are betting that it will not be long before women in the Kingdom can drive. We
plan to clean up by building the separate road system tins may require. (That's a joke, I hope,)
A word about the vision embodied in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology. Founded by
the king last Septernber with an initial endowment of ten billion dollars. KAUST is an international, graduate-
level research university. It sits in a two-billion-dollar campus on the Red Sea about seventy-five miles
northwest of Mecca. On one level, it is the leading element in an effort to prepare the Kingdom for a
knowledge-based economy that can complement and eventually supercede the current reliance on energy
exports. But on another level, it is a powerful answer to the religious zealotry that terrorist movements like al
Qa'ida espouse. Let me explain.
There is a broad consensus among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims that the modern age is ethically corrupt and
that religious faith needs reinvigoration and renewal. Much like early Christian Protestants, many believe that
the way to achieve this is to rediscover and reaffirm the values of their religion's earliest times. When he
inaugurated KAUST, King Abdullah explained that he envisaged it as a reborn Bayt al-Hikma or ""House of
Wisdom."" The original ""House of Wisdom"" was founded in Baghdad around 760 CE., in the second century of
the Muslim era. It was where the Arabs incorporated Greek, Indian and other foreign knowledge into Islam and
conceived much of modern mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology, and geography. It made
Islamic civilization the global leader in science and technology. The ""House of Wisdom"" prospered in an age
of tolerance, when Jews and Christians served alongside Muslims as ministers of government. Though

destroyed by the Mongols in 1258, the knowledge it preserved and developed eventually found its way to
Europe, where it sparked the Renaissance.
Today, like mainstream Muslims, the extremists of al Qa'ida and related movements argue that Islam must
return to its roots. But they portray early Islam as puritanical, xenophobic, intolerant, and oppressive of
women.. KAUST is a living rebuttal of this historical fallacy and the ideology of hatred derived from it. It was
conceived as a new ""House of Wisdom."" It stands for the principle that Islam was founded as and can only be
reborn as the religious guide to a society open to ideas from other traditions. It represents a call for return to an
Islam tolerant of foreign ways, respectful of women, dedicated to the scientific study of God's handiwork, and
committed to the development of new technologies to better the human condition. KAUST is as much an
instrument of religious renaissance and an answer to extremism as it is an academic institution.
This brings me to the issue of religious tolerance. In 2003, King Abdullah inaugurated what he called a
""national forum for intellectual dialogue."" This ongoing national dialogue is an unprecedented acceptance of
religious diversity in the Kingdom. It marks an end to longstanding official discrimination against its Shiite
minority. In 2007, King Abdullah made an historic call on the Pope in the Vatican, the first time a Muslim
leader of his stature had done so. In 2008 he organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences
between Muslims, Jews, Christians. Buddhists, and others at Madrid and New York. He intends this dialogue,
too, to be a continuing process.
There are other major domestic reform initiatives in progress, like a complete revamping of the Saudi
educational system and curriculum, experiments with elections at lower levels of government and civil society,
efforts to shift the Kingdom toward reliance on alternative sources of energy, the development of a huge new
petrochemical industry to complement the production of energy in its primary form. Time will not permit me to
describe these developments. My point is simply that there is a great deal more going on in Saudi Arabia than
our press and pundits seem to realize.
That said, everything is, of course, relative. Sadly, to many Saudis, the history of their nation suggests that the
more religiously uptight they are, the more oil comes out of the ground. The Kingdom continues in many ways
to belie God's admonition in the Holy ()limn that ""there can be no compulsion in religion."" The open practice
of religions other than Islam remains banned. The status and role of wonien in &tudi society is controversial
and far from settled. Despite efforts at ""Saudiization,"" foreign workers continue to dominate the employment
market, while demanding a premium to compensate for the discomfort and stress that Saudi Arabia's religiously
sanctioned mores impose on them. Methods of political consultation that worked in a more cohesive and less
populous Saudi Arabia can no longer produce consensus. The fiscal basis of the state continues to be oil
exports, and oil is a commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably. There is, in other words, a very long list
of problems for Saudis to work out in coming years.
Let me turn briefly to Saudi Arabia's foreign relations before reviewing the state of our country's interaction
with it.
In foreign even more than domestic affairs, King Abdullah's impact has been little short of revolutionary. He
has overseen the negotiated settlement of the Kingdom's long-disputed borders with all of its neighbors. He
brought Saudi Arabia into the World Trade Organization, ensuring that its trade arid investment activities for the
first time follow internationally agreed rules. In 1982, at Beirut, he led the Arab League in an historic reversal.
of policy toward the Israel-Palestine issue. Saudi Arabia had long insisted that it would be the last state in the
region to recognize and establish relations with Israel. At Beirut, King Abdullah committed to be the first to
normalize relations with Israel upon its achievement of a mutually acceptable arrangement for coexistence with
the Palestinians. He persuaded all other Arab countries to promise they would do the same. To his great
frustration. Israel did not respond. Since then, hope for a two-state solution that could gain acceptance for Israel
in the region has dimmed.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767140 Date: 08/31/2015
Many of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy challenges stem from recent American policies in the region. These
policies have had the effect of liberating Israel from all constraints on its settlement activities and belligerent
intervention in its Arab neighbors, installing Iran as the dominant political influence in both Iraq and Lebanon,
consolidating rather than eroding the Syrian-Iranian alliance, pushing Hama.s into the arms of the Iranians, and
raising regional tensions over Tehran's nuclear program while doing nothing effective about it. Then there is
Afghanistan, where the United States now seems to be engaged in a crusade against militant Islam — one that
many in the region now fear may soon extend to Yemen. Saudi counter-terrorism specialists, Who have a well-
deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are convinced that the most efficient way to radicalize
Muslim populations and encourage terrorism against the United States and its foreign policy partners is to
invade, occupy, and humiliate them. They believe that the panick.ed militarism of the U.S. response to 9/11 was
exactly what groups like al Qa'ida, hoped for. They see no sign that the United States is about to abandon
actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against Americans and our
foreign friends.
No longer willing to be publicly associated with U.S. policies in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and
elsewhere that radicalize the region and menace the Kingdom's own security, Saudi Arabia is actively
attempting to reduce its historic dependence on America. To this end, it is building new relationships with
countries like China, India, and. Russia, while strengthening cooperation with longstanding partners in Europe
and Asia like Britain, France, Germany, japan, and south Korea. It is not that the Kingdom has given up on the
United States. As the king's scholarship program for Saudi students in this country evidences., Saudi Arabia
continues to reach out and seek improved relations with America. But Saudis no longer trust us to take their
interests into account or to protect them from their enemies.
In December 2002, as the U.S. prepared to invade Iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of then Crown
Prince Abdullab, Saudi Aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned a decades-old subsidy for
the cost of shipping oil to the North American market. Within months, China replaced the United States as the
Kingdom's biggest overseas market for oil. U.S. exports have remained relatively constant as the Saudi
Arabian economy has boomed, dramatically' reducing our market share in our largest Middle Eastern
market. Ironically, the best element of the US-Saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. This is a
task in which the Saudis have perforce learned to excel. American policies ensure an endless supply of angry
young Muslim men in the region, including in Saudi Arabia.
The United States is now said to have entered a ""long war."" The last time we did so, in 1947 with Soviet
Communism„ the enemy was obvious, George Ketman gave us a strategy, and skillful American diplomacy
gave us the allies we needed to pursue it. Kennan's ""long telegram"" from Moscow outlined a comprehensive
approach to the political, economic, cultural, and military containment of the threat to our survival and our
values posed by the Soviet Union. We followed his outline. Forty years later, as Kerman forecast, without our
having to go to war with the USSR, ohr Soviet enemy collapsed of its own infirmities.
This time, our ""long war"" is with various Islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. Were not quite sure
who our enemy is. No K.ennan has emerged to give us a strategy for winning without fighting or, indeed, any
""strategy"" at all. Instead, we are flailing about with our superbly lethal military in response to events. Lacking
a strategy, we have been unable to recruit foreign partners to support one. We are now alone in Iraq. We are
isolated internationally on the Israel-Palestine issue. Our NATO allies are with us in Afghanistan out of
consideration for NATO, not because they think we know what we are doing. Many of them have already
announced their intention to withdraw-. Pakistan is with us only because all its alternatives are worse.
Saudi Arabia and America head al Qa•ida'S enemies list. The Kingdom has, however, been successfully vilified
in the eyes of the American elite and public. To deal effectively with Islamic extremism, we need Muslim
allies. There is none more potent that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Yet we have made no effort to seek its
advice about how to address the challenges of Islamic extremism. We have not sought its help to legitimize an

effective political, informational, cultural, and economic strategy for productive engagement with the Islamic
world.
Meanwhile, however, many things now happening in the Kingdom — like the implicit message of the king's
vision for KAUST — suggest that such a partnership with Saudi Arabia and Arab nations of like mind is
possible. Such a partnership could be the basis for a strategy to bring victory- in this latest ""long war."" The
common interests on which to forge an alliance are clearlY there. Last June in Cairo, President Obama
brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound relations with the Islamic world. His vision was persuasive, but
it remains a mirage, not a reality. Et is past time to implement it. An intensive effort to reset the relationship
with Saudi Arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king would be a good place to start.

Successfully Engaging Global Media
About the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in Haiti
Examples of Post Efforts to Date
EUROPE
• Reinforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directly
with over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted
U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with France, the UN and the
international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee,
MFA, French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive
coordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USG
in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensions
between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama
administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.
• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S.
commitment to Haiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James
Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide)
and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about Haiti on January 20-
22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show,"" BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and
other media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's
previously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attention
to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiers
from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.
• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an
interview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in
Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper, resulting in positive stories about U.S.
assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia, whose
paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to
run an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation.
AFRICA
• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful
outreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with
African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s African
Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief
to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance
to Haitians, PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live
interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in excellent media placement in all
four countries.
• On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on
Haiti with 5FM, a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The
Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africa
for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails and
SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips
reached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a
program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-International TV's ""Rendezvous
Africa"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radio
programs on two national stations.
• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan
media gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola
and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an editorial January 23 that stated: ""We need
to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing who
is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this
is not acceptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea
and quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede
the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in Haiti.""
EAST ASIA-PACIFIC
• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the
editorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the
Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media.
• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA
Seoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had
previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Korean
speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as
well as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active
involvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the
earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in three days, with almost
all comments supporting U.S. concerns.
The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid
in Haiti on January 25 that included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper,
Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency),
and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in favorable
stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.
NEAR EAST
• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding
coming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and
mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in Haiti to
Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes
on morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO
was able to address many of the accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the
myriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets.
[Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designated
as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]
• Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-ed
entitled, ""Haiti: After terror, the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairly
hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion to
discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,
accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately
agreed that the piece had been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself
by saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from ""the Bush years,"" but readily
acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier of
Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he
promised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L 'Opinion published an article
entitled, ""The massive humanitarian action of the United States,"" based on the articles
provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance, both
government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.
• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been
largely negative and inaccurate, portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples
include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01)
under the headlines: ""US Crimes in Haiti,"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti,"" and
""US Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10, government-owned
Tishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a military
conquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations, which is the new method
of colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafa,
who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. To
encourage more balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with
-
journalists from government-owned and independent Syrian media. Post also extended a
personal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767157 Date: 08/31/2015

with over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted
U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with France, the UN and the
international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee,
MFA, French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive
coordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USG
in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensions
between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama
administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.
• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S.
commitment to Haiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James
Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide)
and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about Haiti on January 20-
22 on BBC TV 2's ""Daily Politics Show,"" BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and
other media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's
previously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attention
to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiers
from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.
• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an
interview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in
Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper, resulting in positive stories about U.S.
assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia, whose
paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to
run an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation.

AFRICA
• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful
outreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with
African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s African
Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief
to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance
to Haitians, PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live
interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in excellent media placement in all
four countries.
• On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on
Haiti with 5FM, a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The
Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africa
for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails and
SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips
reached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a
program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-International TV's ""Rendezvous
Africa"" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radio
programs on two national stations.
• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan
media gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola
and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an editorial January 23 that stated: ""We need
to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing who
is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this
is not acceptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea
and quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede
the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in Haiti.""
EAST ASIA-PACIFIC
• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the
editorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the
Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media.
• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA
Seoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had
previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Korean
speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as
well as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active
involvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the

earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in three days, with almost
all comments supporting U.S. concerns.
The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid
in Haiti on January 25 that included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper,
Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency),
and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in favorable
stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.
NEAR EAST
• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding
coming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and
mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in Haiti to
Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes
on morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO
was able to address many of the accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the
myriad ""weapons testing"" myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets.
[Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designated
as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]
• Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-ed
entitled, ""Haiti: After terror, the dread..."" The paper is generally considered to be fairly
hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion to
discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,
accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately
agreed that the piece had been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself
by saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from ""the Bush years,"" but readily
acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier of
Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he
promised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L 'Opinion published an article
entitled, ""The massive humanitarian action of the United States,"" based on the articles
provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance, both
government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.
• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been
largely negative and inaccurate, portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples
include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01)
under the headlines: ""US Crimes in Haiti,"" ""US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti,"" and
""US Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing."" On 1/25/10, government-owned
Tishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a military
conquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations, which is the new method
of colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafa,
who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. To
encourage more balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with

But tonight, Wednesday, Shaun has got Robinson and McGuiness to agree to all points, pushing past the previous
sticking point on the Minister of Justice and relation to the Executive. The matter now rests with Robinson and his ability
to sell it tomorrow. He has told Shaun and Gordon he believes he can do it. He needs 75 percent of his party. So, the

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran
and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.)
On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always
coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives:
According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The
regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions
puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a
stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies
application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open.
The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A
purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking
of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is
a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the
wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political
killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their
bomb in reserve.

P.J.--Thanks for the headsup about question. I was not saying anything new and believe I have said this before
and am copying both Philippe and Jake so all three of you can help me remember when, where and whether. Also, I
believe the POTUS has also said this. Let's discuss tomorrow.

Subject: U.N. Rejects 'Militarization' of Afghan Aid (NYT, Nordland)
By ROD NORDLAND
Published: February 18, 2010 KABUL, Afghanistan -Senior United Nations officials
in Afghanistan on Wednesday criticized NATO forces for what one referred to as
""the militarization of humanitarian aid,"" and said United Nations agencies would
not participate in the military's reconstruction strategy in Marja as part of its
current offensive there. ""We are not part of that process, we do not want to be
part of it,"" said Robert Watkins, the deputy special representative of the
secretary general, at a news conference attended by other officials to announce
the United Nations' Humanitarian Action Plan for 2010. ""We will not be part of
that military strategy."" The American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A.
McChrystal, has made the rapid delivery of governmental services, including
education, health care and job programs, a central part of his strategy in Marja,
referring to plans to rapidly deploy what he has referred to as ""a government in
a box"" once Marja is pacified. Mr. Watkins did not specifically criticize the
Marja offensive, saying, ""It is not the military that will be delivering the
services, they will be clearing the area so the government can deliver those
services."" However, the United Nations would not be participating, he said. Wael
Haj-Ibrahim, head of the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs here, said the military should not be involved in providing
health care or schools. ""If that aid is being delivered as part of a military
strategy, the counterstrategy is to destroy that aid,"" Mr. Haj-Ibrahim said.
""Allowing the military to do it is not the best use of resources."" Instead, he
said, the military should confine itself to clearing an area of security threats
and providing security for humanitarian organizations to deliver services. ""The
distribution of aid by the military gives a very difficult impression to the
communities and puts the lives of humanitarian workers at risk,"" Mr. Watkins
said. Last month, eight leading humanitarian organizations working in

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767257 Date: 08/31/2015
Afghanistan, including Oxfam and ActionAid, issued a joint report that was highly
critical of the International Security Assistance Force, as the American-led NATO
force is known, because of ""the international militaries' use of aid as a
'nonlethal' weapon of war."" They maintained that this violated an agreement
between international forces and the United Nations that the military's primary
role should be to provide security and, only when there is no other alternative,
to provide limited developmental and humanitarian assistance. The agencies
maintain they are able to work in conflict areas of Afghanistan when local
residents see them as independent and not connected with the military, and this
approach puts that at risk. ""Military-led humanitarian and development activities
are driven by donors' political interests and short-term security objectives and
are often ineffective, wasteful and potentially harmful to Afghans,"" a statement
by Oxfam said. The United Nations officials expressed the same concern, though
more diplomatically, and one official, who did not want to be quoted by name
because of the political sensitivity of the issue, said the United Nations had
repeatedly raised those concerns with the international forces without success.
The American military refers to its strategy, first enunciated in Iraq in 2006,
as ""clear, hold and build."" Previously there were insufficient foreign and Afghan
troops in Afghanistan to pursue that strategy systematically because they were
unable to hold large areas for long periods of time. The offensive in Marja is
intended as a showcase where the strategy can work, and the coalition says it has
adequate forces now to do that. ""Clear, hold and build, it's short-sighted for
two reasons,"" the United Nations official said. ""Territory changes hands in a
conflict, and if the services are associated with a particular group, it will be
destroyed."" That has happened often with projects like schools and clinics around
the country. The officials were particularly critical of NATO's planned ""civilian
surge,"" bringing in more government-financed aid workers involved in projects
like the country's provincial reconstruction teams, which are located in each
province and designed to provide fast-track development and aid services in their
areas. These reconstruction teams are NATO groups run by various allied
countries, including Canada in Kandahar, and Britain in Lashkar Gah, and they
primarily disburse development and aid money locally in each province.Many of the
reconstruction teams, the official said, see their role as providing services in
exchange for intelligence-gathering and political activity directed against the
insurgents. He declined to identify any that operate under that premise, although
he added that not all did so. In many parts of the country, only nongovernmental
organizations are able to operate safely because of the security situation, and
they fill the gap in governmental services. Because the reconstruction teams are
run by foreigners and are associated with their countries' militaries, they need
to go out with heavy security, and aid groups worry that locals begin to
associate all aid workers with the military. Oxfam said the military ""was going
way beyond its remit"" in Afghanistan, citing an American Army counterinsurgency
manual that defines humanitarian aid as a ""nonlethal weapon.""A statement issued
Wednesday by the international forces emphasized the military's new, population-
centered approach to fighting the insurgents. ""The conduct of Operation Moshtarak
is visibly demonstrating that the force has changed the way it operates and that
it is working with and for the people of Afghanistan,"" the statement said,
referring to the Marja offensive. It also suggested the military phase of the
operation could be protracted. ""The insurgents are tactically adept, have
resilience and are cunning, so continued tactical patience on the part of the
combined force is important. Mining is significant in areas, and the combined

force must be very deliberate in its movement in order to minimize local Afghan
and combined force casualties."" The United Nations' Humanitarian Action Plan has
a proposed budget of $870.5 million, a substantial increase over previous years,
because the increased level of NATO military activity has led to increased needs
for services in many parts of the country, according the United Nations.

this week David was for many years the president of the
New World Foundation. During that period the Secretary served on the board of the foundation
and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be informed of David's
death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a
private meeting with the First Lady which was just the two of them. I can provide additional
details on the memorial service if she were interested but the family's concern was only that she
be informed. Mort

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal

Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April
* Henry McDonald <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald>
* guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.ulç/>, Friday 5 February 2010 11.42 GMT

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last

three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Thank you for taking the time to send this message; you can be sure it will be read by many people. We know that we
touch lives in the course of our work, sometimes during moments of unimaginable anguish, nearly always at a time of
tremendous stress and worry. It is a privilege to be in a position to help. We never forget that the spirit and heart with
which we respond to citizens in trouble matter as much as the actions we take.
We are all celebrating the safe travel to the U.S. of these six little children, and the hundreds of others we've been able
to assist under the orphan humanitarian parole program. Thank you very much for your great work and for the valuable
information you kept sending us throughout the past few days.

Thanks again for all your great work on allowing the six adopted kids to leave haiti to go to their adopting families.
Please forward this to all involved. I was very impressed by how all of you handled such a difficult situation. I got a little
sense of what you were facing as the moms would call me on the hour! I know these six children are such a small part
of the challenges everyone working in haiti faces each day, but the fact that people cared so much to help gives me such
faith in our efforts and State Department staff. I will write all of this in a letter to Secretary Clinton, but please know

Haiti®s prime minister targeted for
ouster by lawmakers
Haitian senators want to oust the country's prime minister, clad ing
she has moved too slowly in addressing crucial problems.
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
JCHARLES@MIAMIHERALD.COM
PORT-AU-PRINCE -- With Haiti poised to enjoy the economic benefits of long-elusive stability, foreign
diplomats are scrambling behind the scenes to keep it all from unraveling as several lawmakers derhand the
ouster of the country's prime minister.
A small but powerful group of senators is seeking the removal of Prime Minister Miche&grave;le Pierre-Louis --
and possibly several of her ministers -- on charges that she has moved too slowly to solve Haiti's problems.
""The situation is critical,"" said Sen. Jean Hector Anacasis, who is among the six senators behind a recent
summons for Pierre-Louis to appear before Haiti's Senate on Thursday. Under Haiti's constitution, the Senate
can fire a sitting government.
""We are the ones on the ground who hear the people's cry, who hear them criticizing us, the government,
saying nothing has been done. We have to replace the woman,"" Anacasis said. ""If they are accusing us of
inviting a crisis, then we are inviting a crisis to avert another crisis.""
The internal political maneuvering comes just three weeks after former U.S. President and U.N. Special Envoy
to Haiti Bill Clinton led a historic trade mission here, triggering optimism that this land of seemingly missed
opportunities may finally be turning around.

Before a gathering of 600 investors -- 200 of them foreign -- Clinton championed Haiti's stability, promising that
the risks were the lowest they have ever been in a crisis-prone Haiti. Now, both Haitian and foreign observers
fear that political differences could trigger a crisis and send potential investors packing.
""They cannot afford to do this. It is not good for investments,"" said one diplomat who asked for anonymity
because of the sensitivity of what is viewed as a domestic matter. ""It is all so frustrating.""
On Monday, diplomats spent the day shuffling between meetings with President Rene Preval, and discussions
with Pierre-Louis. The matter even warranted a weekend phone call to Preval from U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton. Clinton spoke of her concerns and reiterated U.S. support for Pierre-Louis, according to several
sources privy to the conversation.
Preval, in turn, told Clinton that he was not behind the move to oust Pierre-Louis and has no control over the
lawmakers. Critics disagree, pointing out that following the recent Senate elections, marred by fraud
allegations and low turnout, Preval now controls two-thirds of the chamber, and that most of the six senators
leading the charge are from his Lespwa (HOPE) political coalition,
POLITICALLY RISKY
Still, some are asking whether he's willing to spend the political capital to prevent the ouster of Pierre-Louis, a
one-time friend and confidante who accepted her appointment as a storm-battered Haiti was gripped by
political gridlock after the Senate fired then-Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis following food riots then
failed to ratify two of Preval's choices.
Neither Preval nor Pierre-Louis responded to interview requests from The Miami Herald. In a taped message to
the nation Monday night, Pierre-Louis defended her government's record and explained her reasons for taking
the job.
Since her appointment a year ago, Pierre-Louis has appeared often before parliament but this is the first time
she has been summoned, a move that usually signals a no-confidence vote.
Pierre-Louis has mustered considerable support abroad from her many trips, including stops in South Florida.
But she has failed to win over supporters in parliament. Her dismissal, in effect, would topple her government.
Initially, senators were seeking to dismiss the ministers of finance and justice, both of whom are close to
Pierre-Louis. But after three days of meetings at a hotel near the palace, senators decided to issue the
summons to Pierre-Louis, Anacasis told The Miami Herald.
A majority of the 29 senators have indicated they would vote to fire Pierre-Louis, Anacasis said.

Pierre-Louis was in Europe on business, and returned to Haiti Sunday night where she was greeted by a small
group of protesters waving signs saying, ""We are tired of changing governments.""
In her defense, a handful of lawmakers and supporters have pleaded with the group of six to cancel Thursday's
hearing.
'SELF-INTEREST
""Since becoming prime minister, she,has struggled with limited human and financial resources and with a
structure of government that has been emasculated over decades of mismanagement and selfish politics,"" said
Robert Maguire, a Haiti expert at Washington, D.C.-based Trinity University.
""She has had to confront the narrow politics of self-interest imposed upon her ability to govern. And yet, she
has persevered, building a solid track record of relief and recovery in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating
storms of late 2008 and thereby contributing immensely to that spirit of Haiti's hope for a brighter future.""
It's unclear what has triggered the move, though some believe it revolves around Haiti's presidential elections.
While still a year away, political jockeying already has begun, with some suggesting politicians may be seeking
to position themselves and candidates for the scheduled November 2010 elections.
Meanwhile on Monday, as politicians weighed whether Pierre-Louis would fight or resign, some supporters
tried to persuade her to visit Preval to see if the two could reach a compromise. She has said she will fight, but
has no plans to go before parliament and be humiliated. That has some wondering whether she would resign
before Thursday.
Patrick Delatour, Haiti's tourism and acting commerce minister, said lawmakers should weigh the
consequences of their actions carefully.
""They should understand solving problems by any government is a process, a slow process,"" he said. ""Firing
this government does not mean the next government will be able to solve the problems any faster. It definitely
means the process of solving problems will stop and will have to start again.""

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.

Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

summit sidelines
Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president
European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the
divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.
The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and
how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior
diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get
the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for
summits at least four times a year.
David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a ""strong voice"" on the global stage, but his
comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved
that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.
Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair
personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the
former prime minister's behalf.
""We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,"" said an
official. ""There is only one candidate.""
That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the
only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.
Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed
as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.
While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the
meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.
While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767474 Date: 07/31/2015

meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.

While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.

See NI - are you home now - if so I am going to call
Abedin,
If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).

Ted and Drew,
This evening at approximately 5:30pm local time, I received a call from Argentine judge Federico Summer of Neuquen
province (borders Chile in southwest Argentina). He advised me that on Monday, November 23, 2009, a 16-year old

local boy discovered the decomposed body of a male in a remote wooded area overlooking the lake in the Patagonian
town of San Martin de los Andes. The judge mentioned he had seen last week's television interview
(http://www.infobae.comkienera1/485486-601275-0-Un-norteamericano-desaparecido-hace-casi-dos-meses-el-
packCYADADs) in which I described Roberto Yaryura's disappearance on September 19, 2009, and he remembered the
photo of the unique tattoo on Roberto's right arm mentioned in the interview and widely published in the national
media here throughout Argentina.
The judge sent me the pictures of the body taken at the location where it was found, and I sent one picture, a close-up
shot of the tattooed right arm to Roberto's best friend (who recently flew down here for 10 days to search for him) for
identification. He and the artist who designed the unique tattoo, also one of Roberto's best friends, confirmed for me
over the phone that it was, indeed, Roberto's tattoo in the photo.
I notified Roberto's siblings, together with their families, and they
asked me
until after their sister had given her the news in person later tonight. I confirmed that I would wait until tomorrow to
contact to discuss her preference for disposition of Roberto's body and transfer of the remains.
Judge Summer noted that they are conducting an autopsy on Roberto's body to rule out foul play, and that the case is
now considered an open criminal investigation until the autopsy results determine he died of natural causes. Local
medics estimate the time of death to be approximately thirty to forty days prior the body's discovery. The judge added
that he would do everything possible to expedite any necessary paperwork with respect to disposition of the body once
they have ruled out any criminal aspect to this case. would like to fly down next week, if
possible, to pick up his remains to bring them back to the United States.
I would like to thank my colleagues in Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, copied here, for all their efforts to track
down Roberto. In my conversation with the siblings, they wanted me to pass on their gratitude to everyone for their
efforts to find Roberto.
Best,
Shannon

Re: Distant early warning signs
You should read this. This piece is prominently featured today in the Telegraph. It is a Tory
paper. But it reflects more or less the current conventional wisdom in the UK. Of course, it's
much worse in France. Sarkozy's unleashed id is the barometer. You are still perceived as
separate and even increasingly as compensatory. The more coverage of your NI role, the better,
if it can be done. (Let me discuss with Shaun on a strategy on how to brief.) The China/Google
stand was critical. What can be done in Middle East, esp Syria, push back against Avigdor
Lieberman's recent unpleasant noises, with new US ambo going? Just a thought. And: the
attitude that the president's cancellation of attendance at US-EU summit is simply a merited
position is self-defeating. First, the Europeans learned from the press, not through diplomatic
channels beforehand, treated as second class. Second, of course the EU is what it is, esp after the
new nonentities named at its head at Merkel and Sarko's behest. But to dismiss the EU because
of that is smug and complacent. If the EU has no agenda, it's really up to the US, as it was for 50
years before. It's up to the US to organize around a new agenda on the crisis of global economy,
including a common approach to China's mercantilism and climate change, etc, nuclear
proliferation, etc. Otherwise, petty trade wars will begin to dominate US-EU relations.

Barack Obama: stumbling towards
isolationism
One of the ironies of Barack Obama's presidency is that he
is increasingly distant from the world he promised to
embrace, writes Toby Harnden in Washington
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767523 Date: 08/31/2015

Toby Hamden's American Way
Published: 2:00PM GMT 06 Feb 2010
Europeans cheered Barack Obama every step of the way to the White House.
They swooned when the candidate took his stump skills to Berlin, where he spoke of ""the
burdens of global citizenship"" and promised to ""remake the world"".
He had lived in Indonesia as a boy, travelled to Pakistan and Africa in his youth and came from a
family that looked, as he liked to quip, ""like the United Nations"". Then, in his first year in office,
he made 10 trips abroad to 21 countries, making him the most travelled of all United States
presidents in their first 12 months.
So it came as a rude shock to Europeans last week when Obama decided not to bother with the
European Union knees up Madrid in May - particularly miffing Prime Minister Jose Luis
Zapatero of Spain, who, like the American president, campaigned on his opposition to the Iraq
war.
American officials intimated that they were unimpressed by European bickering over who would
sit next to the Obamas at the summit dinner and even over who would be the first leader to shake
the hand of the person that Oprah Winfrey anointed as ""the One"" in Iowa back in 2008.
Perhaps Obama himself was a touch irritated by Nicolas Sarkozy's new habit of mocking him.
""Obama has been in power for a year, and he has already lost three special elections,"" the French
president said last week. ""Me, I have won two legislative elections and the EU election. What
can one say I've lost?""
The discomfort of Europe's elites indicates growing a realisation that perhaps he's just not that
into them. The fact that Hillary Clinton, Obama's Secretary of State, felt the need to point out
that ""European security remains an anchor of US foreign and security policy"" spoke volumes.
There is little sign that Obama feels the kind of instinctive belief in transatlantic alliances that,
for instance, President George W Bush felt. In Washington, the much-ballyhooed ""special
relationship"" - a phrase that Team Obama views as betraying a British inferiority complex and
cloying neediness - has never felt less special.
That's partly because Gordon Brown is viewed as so toxic by the Obama administration that
dealings with Downing Street are in a state of virtual suspended animation. But there are no
indications yet that a Prime Minister David Cameron will have the red carpet rolled out for him.
One of Obama's conceits was that he would be the ""Pacific president"", looking west from his
native Hawaii to China, India and Japan rather than east to America's traditional allies. It's as if
Obama has embraced Donald Rumsfeld's much-maligned concept of ""old Europe"" - and
broadened it.

The Czech Republic and Poland were told in late-night phone calls that planned missile defence
sites on their territory were being abandoned.
Mid-level American officials often produce plans and papers about Helmand that overlook the
fact that British troops have been fighting and dying there since 2006.
Obama's foreign policy sometimes seems like it does not go much further than the concept of ""le
monde, c'est moi"". The limits of his transcendental personality in terms of results are becoming
as apparent abroad as they are at home.
Relations with China sunk to a new low last week after the Obama decided to sell $6.4 billion in
arms to Taiwan and to meet the Dalai Lama. After kowtowing to China by avoiding discussion
of human rights in a humiliatingly ineffectual trip last November and failing to see the Tibetan
monk, Obama's decided to get tough - though to what end is unclear.
Having offered an ""unclenched fist"" to Iran, Obama has been almost casually rebuffed. As
Sarkozy put it: ""What have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international
community? Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges.""
In the Middle East, Obama's popularity is sliding among both Israelis and Arabs and the
prospects of meaningful peace talks are dire. Requests to Nato for more troops to train Afghan
security forces have fallen largely on deaf ears. Suddenly, the US no longer feels like the
indispensable nation.
For all his talk of reaching out to the world and his apologies on behalf of America, there is little
that Obama has achieved. He is liked but not respected - and there are growing doubts about
whether he has the backbone or the domestic political capital to deliver.
Obama is finding that foreign policy is about more than just talk and turning up to take a bow.
For its part, the world is realising that the man it championed as one of its own is stumbling
towards isolationism.

Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

S can announce the breakthrough. She should say something like:
-- I welcome news of a breakthrough in negotiations in Honduras.
-- I congratulate the Honduran people, President Zelaya, and Mr. Micheletti for this historic agreement.
-- I also congratulate Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for the important role he played in fashioning the San Jose
process, and the OAS for its role in facilitating this successful round of talks.
-- I cannot think of another example of a country that, having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional
order, overcome such a crisis through negotiation and dialogue. This is an a big step forward for the inter-American
system and its commitment to democracy as embodied in the Inter-american Democratic Charter.
-- we were proud to be part of this process, and commit ourselves to working with Honduras as it prepares for elections.

Importance: High
Hello and Happy New Year Jim,
Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual ""Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger"" Award to Secretary Clinton
this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms).
Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders,
administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.
As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.

Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton
will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either a
Tuesday or Wednesday evening (at approximately 6:30/7pm). We would select the specific date based on Secretary
Clinton's schedule.
I think the ceremony would provide another good opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unprecedented commitment
of Secretary Clinton and President Obama to addressing global hunger. Thank you for your help in engaging the
appropriate officials in the State Department.
All the Best,
Rick Leach

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Update
Friends,
As 2009 comes to a close, we wanted to provide you with an update on the U.S. Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative and share with you what is to come in the new year.
First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative
consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the document, and we will
soon release a new version that reflects this input.
We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.
In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food security
that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the World Summit
on Food Security in Rome.
1)Invest in country-owned plans
2)Foster strategic coordination
3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767798 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767798 Date: 08/31/2015
4) Ensure a strong role for the multilateral system
5) Ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security and
nutrition
In establishing the Rome Principles, the international community declared a new business model for coordinated action
to increase global food security.
Translating these principles into action, on December 6-8, the Government of Rwanda, together with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, hosted a technical review of its Agriculture Sector Investment
Plan and convened a high-level stakeholders meeting. At the meeting, development partners and the African
Union/NEPAD endorsed Rwanda's plan and agreed to mobilize support for scaled-up financing. The African
Union/NEPAD and representatives from the World Bank, UN, donor countries, the private sector, civil society
organizations, and NGOs attended the meeting.
The United States was represented by a whole-of-government team led by Special Assistant to the President Gayle
Smith that included representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, USAID, and MCC. Our
team committed to improve the quality of our aid; to provide robust financial commitments and technical support; and
to work to mobilize additional financing of the Investment Plan.
In the new year, we will continue to engage all stakeholders, work with the international community, and build on our
experience in Rwanda as we move forward with plans to implement our initiative.
Please continue to visit our website: www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity to stay informed of planning for the initiative
and to provide input.
We wish you a happy new year and look forward to continuing to work closely with you.
The Global Hunger and Food Security Team

to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.
LA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...
As you know the general theme is ""Better Cities, Better Lives"". How can NYC not be repped? They cam brag about their
innovations.

This will be an important two weeks to nail down these big companies. We are negotiating with them now about
possible options. I'll keep you posted.
May be good to mention this to Mayor Bloomberg if you run into him or see him. Doctoroff gave us rom
Bloomberg, LLC but he thght the Mayor may be interested for the city.

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are
in fo nd then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of
Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done.
each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.
C-Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D-We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the range).
E-We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.

I noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.

Google's announcement on their blog:
A new approach to China
1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM
Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular
basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate
infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.
However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a
significant one--was something quite different.
First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least
twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance,
technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the
process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.
Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail
accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack
did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that
activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject
line, rather than the content of emails themselves.
Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that
the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human
rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not
been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware
placed on the users' computers.
We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural
improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we
would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to
install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious
when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal
information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security

recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S.
government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve's bloq and this presentation on the GhostNet spying
incident.
We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not
just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also
because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech.
In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have
lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of
much economic progress and development in the world today.
We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to
information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to
censor some results. At the time we made clear that ""we will carefully monitor conditions in China,
including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to
achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China.""
These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past
year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the
feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue
censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the
Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law,
if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our
offices in China.
The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that
it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven
by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in
China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed
to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.

A quick summary from Ibrahim; these comments were made prior to the FoLLow-Up Cty meeting,
which is now underway. -rw
In press statements this evening, NAR stressed that the PA and the PLO are committed to the
Arab position which will be developed in the meeting of the Arab Follow Up committee in
Cairo. In response to a question at the beginning of the meeting on President Abbas's
presentation to the committee, NAR said that the ideas that will be presented are not those
of President Abu Mazen but basically are about the US responses to the Palestinian questions
in relation to the role of Senator Mitchell in the 'proximity talks. He will also stress
that the Palestinian position will be the same as the Arab position.
He added that these ideas will be presented to the to the Arab Follow Up committee and we
shall see what the Arabs will say. And we will adhere to the Arab position completely
exactly as we did when we went to Annapolis and to Madrid peace conference. He said the
answer will be provided in the meeting. He went on to say that we have received some
responses from Washington to questions which President Abbas had raised. In response to a
question on whether the US answers constitute an appropriate ground to resume negotiations,
NAR said that the US wants to move the peace process forward and want to create a conducive
atmosphere to launch direct negotiations in the future. He said that the proposed proximity
talks essentially are based on Senator Mitchell continuing his trips between the Palestinians
and Israelis. As far as we are concerned, we shall abide by the Arab position. He also said

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767867 Date: 08/31/2015
we will not develop any position with respect to negotiations without Arab consensus whether
in terms of accepting or rejecting the US ideas.
With regards to resumption of direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, WAR
said that there are no proposals (ideas) at present time to resume direct negotiations. He
said that the Arab and Palestinian position on this issue is clear; there needs to be a clear
TOR for negotiations and total cessation of settlement activities. He said that the PA
position in principle is not against negotiations. On the contrary its for negotiations that
do not waste time since the Palestinian national interest requires a solution as soon as
possible to create the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. WAR went on
to say that before talking about resumption of direct negotiations, there is a need to
clarify the basis of these negotiations and to know the fate of settlements and to what
extent will Israeli abide by freezing settlement activities.
With respect to Israeli provocations which seriously tamper with security and stability, WAR
said that Israel does not want a return to negotiations but wants to blame the Palestinians
by saying they don't want to enter negotiations. WAR went on to say 'It is imperative to take
away this pretext by exposing the real Israeli position to the international community and
the Us administration. He said we are ready to resume negotiations on clear basis but its
the Israeli side that places obstacles to avert meeting its commitments while blaming the
Palestinian side (as Israel is accustomed to doing).

The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general
election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.
The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the
billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had
maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.
The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord
Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords
without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.
With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their
sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.
They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been
masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.
The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two
points over the past year.
The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election
expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent
(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short
of an overall Commons majority.
An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,
in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a
shadow cabinet member as a ""mountain to climb"".
The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission
concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft,
were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite
conclusion.
However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had
destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767969 Date: 08/31/2015

SUbject: Human Rights report on Haiti
Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government, called this morning
asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it. The
Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have gone
through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office. Because
our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to finish
the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the Department
cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to have a copy
in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from Cheers, David

Ma'am — Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - A senior Russian official said Kyrgyz President Bakiyev had not fulfilled a promise to close a U.S. air
base in the Central Asian nation and suggested Moscow would urge its new leaders to do so. ""In Kyrgyzstan there should
be only one base - Russian,"" the official told reporters in Prague on condition of anonymity.

Gentle reminder about the Bob Barnett profile he emailed you about. Story is being written by David Montgomery of the
Washington Post, and is slated to run tomorrow - so we need to do this today, the earlier the better.
All you have to do is call into Ops when you're ready, they will connect you to the reporter (and add me in)
Here's the reporters description on the piece: ""...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation
of what makes Barnett good at what he does, what he has meant to her in the various ways he has worked for her over
the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say
Barnett harkens to a mythic time in Washington when players supposedly could more readily have relationships with
other side, even while sticking to principles in their political work)""
You have talked about Bob many times, but general points:

The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768227 Date: 08/31/2015

So at this point all systems are GO for tomorrow's start of voting.
This was done through an incredible collaboration. My sincere thanks to Katie and Sawsan who made all this

IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their

Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.

HRC,
As of April 21st Dave Stone's former business partner ( James F. Blom ), and I will establish 'Stone Harbour,LLC' (named
for Dave) in Delaware. This will be a nice merger of Dave's and my contacts. Apart from the ongoing vetting of Simon
Stringer's multi purpose software, at several levels, I am keen to help in the human trafficking effort. I have been in
touch with Sharyn Magarian (keeping Kris B informed) in seeking the status of that effort, as I am quite sure the combo
of Dave's former contacts and mine can help. Jim Blom has already spoken to several (Oracle Corp and his friends in
Silicon Valley) and they too are motivated. Work is work, but the human trafficking issue seems like the right thing to do.
All the best, Marty

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the Roman Empire. In
retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and insignificant part of the world-wide empire which
had just won a crushing victory against the rival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion
in Britain. What chances could the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the ""Zealots"". They eliminated the moderate leaders, who warned against
provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also
relied on the Jews in Rome and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps
they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.
We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the temple was burned down. The
last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.
The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke the great powers,
endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted compromises, and every compromise served

them as a basis for the next surge forward. They cleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the
sympathy of the whole world.
But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of Masada has become dominant.
Divine promises once again start to play a role in public discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new
zealots.
The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the new Rome.
WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into something far bigger. The mouse
has given birth to an elephant.
Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama with thinly veiled contempt.
The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black
panther. He gave up his demand for a real settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.
Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his senior assistants condemn the
Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu
must stop all settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the
conflict, including East Jerusalem, and more.
The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian army had crossed the Suez
Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic
tanks. All Jewish organizations in the US were commanded to join the campaign. A1PAC blew the shofar and ordered its
soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.
It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama would be defeated.
And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.
THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.
David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general, son of a Dutch sea captain
who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis, stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was
a ""distinguished cadet"", in Army Command and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped
plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as an assistant professor for
international relations in the US Military Academy.
He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical city in the country. He
concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win over the hearts of the civilian population,
acquire local allies and spend more money than ammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was
considered so outstanding that his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.
His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon became the chief of the
Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East, except Israel and Palestine (which ""belong"" to
the American command in Europe).
When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military thinker, he has no rivals.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768358 Date: 08/31/2015
THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his AOR (Area Of
Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he
called the ""root causes of instability"" in the region. The list was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: ""The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its
neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-
American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the
strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of
moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize
support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas.""
Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a supreme national
interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided support for the Israeli government and impose
the two-state solution.
The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past. (Immediately after the
9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would change its policy. It did not happen then.) But
now this is being stated in an official document written by the responsible American commander.
The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its spokespersons declared that Petraeus
represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn't understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is
not this that made people in Jerusalem break out into cold sweat.
AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits — almost. Every American
politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest deviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to
political suicide.
But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel, the immense might of the pro-Israel lobby
has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its power.
It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive intelligence agency spied
for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his duty to his people. But for the US intelligence
community, he is a traitor who endangered the lives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it
induced the court to impose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of successive
Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his intelligence chiefs in this matter.
But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock Holmes about the dogs that did
not bark. A1PAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for
poor Pollard.
Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything —just anything —for the government of Israel. With one
exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the security of the United States. When the flag of security is
hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans, snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs
above their heads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel ahead of the
security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the mantra that the interests of Israel and the
US are identical.
And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The policy of the present Israeli
government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768358 Date: 08/31/2015
FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been widely aired. But the sword
has been drawn from its scabbard — and American Jews have started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching
earthquake.
This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that Obama is an ""anti-
Semite"". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama is really a Muslim. They represent the radical
right and its allies, who argue in speech and in writing that ""Hussein"" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten
in the coming congressional elections and in the next presidential ones.
(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from convinced by these
insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel is fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than
Netanyahu.)
If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon — the accusation that Israel puts the lives of American
servicemen at risk — this would have catastrophic consequences for Israel.
For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow — a warning shot fired by a warship in order to induce another
vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the present crisis is somehow damped down, it will
inevitably flare up again and again as long as the present coalition in Israel stays in power.
When the movie ""Hurt Locker"" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its concern about the lives of its
soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster
for Netanyahu. And not just for him.

UUP to vote against justice deal
Page last updated at 22:05 GMT, Monday, 8 March 2010 The Ulster Unionist Executive has endorsed the party's decision
to vote against the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland.
The assembly is to vote on whether the powers should be devolved on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, the UUP accused Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward of political and emotional blackmail
ahead of Tuesday's vote.
Danny Kennedy said he had linked the vote to the anniversary of the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll.
The vote takes place exactly a year after the police officer was murdered by the Continuity IRA in Craigavon.
Mr Woodward said transferring justice powers on Tuesday would send an important message to those responsible for
his death and dissident republicans in general.
Bur Mr Kennedy, the UUP's deputy leader, said the secretary of state was guilty of ""political and emotional blackmail""
and called on him to consider his position.
The UUP has been refusing to endorse the Hillsborough Agreement, insisting that matters such as education, parading
and ""the dysfunctional nature of the current executive"" must be addressed.
On Monday night, former DUP leader Ian Paisley said the UUP would be making a ""colossal mistake"" by not backing the
deal.
Mr Paisley was speaking to DUP members in Ballymena as he announced his retirement as MP for north Antrim.
The DUP selected his son, Ian Jnr, as its candidate in the forthcoming Westminster election at the same meeting.
Meanwhile,
It also suggested that 70% of unionists favour Northern Ireland politicians being in charge of policing issues, compared to
83% of nationalists.

Northern Ireland peace process

The former US president George Bush has made a direct plea to David Cameron to support the Northern Ireland peace
process, amid widespread concern in the US about the Tories' new electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists.
In his most active intervention since leaving the White House, Bush took the rare step of calling the Conservative leader to
ask him to use his influence to press his unionist partners to endorse the final stages of the 15-year search for a
settlement.
Bush, who took a close interest in the peace process during his years in the White House, telephoned Cameron last
Friday to ask him to plead with the UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey, to endorse the deal in a vote tomorrow in the Northern
Ireland assembly.
Democrats and Republicans fear that the peace process could be undermined if the Ulster Unionist party, formerly
Northern Ireland's largest party, which governed the province until direct rule was imposed in 1972, votes against the
devolution of policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast.
While the UUP does not have enough votes to scupper the deal, the White House fears a no vote from the UUP could
undermine support for the settlement within the Democratic Unionist party and among the wider unionist community.
Cameron has faced intense pressure in recent months over his decision to form an electoral pact with the UUP, which
could provide him with crucial support if the general election leads to a hung parliament. The pact has prompted fears in
Washington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in the
early years of the peace process.
The Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan
Kelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to
persuade Empey to vote for the deal.
""There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this,"" said one source
familiar with the transatlantic negotiations. ""This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out.""
Another source familiar with the contact said: ""This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post-
presidency period. He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House. He has maintained
radio silence.""
One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: ""The fact that George W Bush
has decided to intervene is really significant. He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an
envoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to.""
A Tory source said: ""George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. David
underlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannot
force Sir Reg to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, 'I can see you are engaged.""
The disclosure of Bush's intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse
the deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see
policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month.
B6
The UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it is
foolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function. In a sign of Empey's unease about
endorsing the deal, a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, Martin McGuinness, broke up
after just three minutes tonight.
The White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care. Hillary
Clinton, the US secretary of state, today pleaded with Empey in a 15-minute telephone call to support the deal.
A group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be
""emboldened"" to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories' partners to endorse the final stage of the peace
process.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768460 Date: 08/31/2015

Courage and Consequence: Less Memoir Than
Hoax
Karl Rove's book Courage and Consequence is less memoir than hoax. The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandal
are yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity as a
covert CIA officer.
His distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair. Wasting his
opportunity to tell the truth, he offers absolutely nothing new, and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparent
effort to continue his long campaign to confuse people, unfortunately consistent with his past behavior.
His book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration, involving our
country in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America.
Nothing in Karl Rove's book refutes those facts. His book, however, is illuminating in further exposing his political
methods, especially his reliance on personal insults, not simply towards Valerie and myself, but also towards all those
who opposed his unprincipled behavior.
If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed, Rove's book demonstrates once again the actions
of a vindictive, angry and petty man. Karl Rove betrayed his nation; now he has betrayed history.

Subject: Secretary's Video Speech
Kurt:
You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai
Rath the leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her
message not as the U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who
cares deeply about Thailand. The writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced
Secretary Clinton's video statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: ""I
would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf
of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the negotiating table so as to end their
conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of sincerity. She started
by saying that she was making this request as ""a long-standing friend of the Thai people"" She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should
consider this an opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring
happiness and peace and that the opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I
believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a book in which she wrote about her brief
visit to Thailand as First Lady several years ago and showed her goodwill toward the Thai people and
Thailand in the book. During her most recent visit to Thailand last year, Mrs. Clinton gave an
interview and expressed her opinion about Thai politics in the most amicable way. Normally, I do not
quite approve of the U.S. because I think it often meddles with other countries' affairs. But I
wholeheartedly agree with Secretary Clinton's request and would like to sincerely thank her for
it."" (To see the video, click here. To read the original article in Thai, click here.)

I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically...""
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States...""
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not...""
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation...""
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected...""
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new
friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...""
[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately
expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the
world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the

For a few reasons
First, calmness is not such a bad thing in these moments. Calm is not cavalier, which you weren't
Second, you're not the EPA administrator or Interior Secretary - nobody will see you as a front line cabinet officer on this
Third, if this is still out of control on Sunday, the administration has bigger problems
So I'm really not worried.
Here it is again which might allay your concerns
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this —
Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible to
mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of business,
however, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further
damage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the
President has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of
drilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars
cleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas, it's going to require a balancing act.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768877 Date: 08/31/2015

Subject: (AP) Israel to investigate settlement announcement during Biden visit
JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's premier has ordered an investigation into how government officials announced plans for a
new Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office said he ordered the probe late Saturday after he met with top Cabinet ministers. While Biden was
visiting earlier this week, Israel's Interior Ministry said it approved plans to build 1,600 homes for Jews in disputed east
Jerusalem. Biden condemned the announcement, which overshadowed his visit. Netanyahu has apologized for the poor
timing of the announcement, but given no sign he will cancel the construction orders. The Palestinians claim east
Jerusalem as their capital, and Israel's annexation of the area is not internationally recognized.

Subject: Border Issues Update
The latest regarding border issues:
a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.
b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report
the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are
sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report ""tens of thousands"" leaving Port-au-
Prince, some for the DR border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry
attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.
c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to
travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally
turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue
being allowed in.
d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on
the Haitian side began demanding ""manifests"" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR
officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear
whether this was an attempt at rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End
Note).
e) As the next Market Day in Jimani will be Thursday, efforts are already underway to see if market activities
that day can be organized so as not to block/hamper through-put of assistance / evacuation vehicles.

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their
cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these
negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769116 Date: 08/31/2015

Hi Jake,
You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team
to Brussels for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had
been receptive, but now the bureaucrats are saying this would be ""counter-productive"", and instead prefer
more regular videoconferences. Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in
case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

4943,"<b>Subject:</b> none<br/><b>Body</b>:<pre class='summary'>After Afghan Shift, Top U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASHINGTON — As General David H.
Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky
future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on
notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special
representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the
uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least
one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to
senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support,
these people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry
might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership
with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr.
Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the
challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how
soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General
Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in
negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before General
Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious
personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one
said, ""there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team."" But the White House believes that the
current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has
reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador
Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the
current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil
structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,"" said a senior State Department
official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by
the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military
effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in
Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.""Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" General
Petraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and do have, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall to
Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000
additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General
Petraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in
Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at
the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador
Eikenberry has master's degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers
intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was
commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General
Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,
while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of
the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new
landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when
his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a
deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the
embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.
He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an
economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies
while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35
countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to
reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,
and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become
more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of
American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling
between Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai
and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins
with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials
said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to
understand Pakistan's concerns. ""Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even
by those who may not like him,"" Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has
wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said,
General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply
more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and
Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769239 Date: 08/31/2015

current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has
reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador
Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the
current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.""You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil
structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,"" said a senior State Department
official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by
the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military
effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in
Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.""Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,"" General
Petraeus said in an interview. ""We have had, and do have, a very good relationship."" That role, he said, will now fall to
Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000
additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General
Petraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in
Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at
the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador
Eikenberry has master's degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers
intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was
commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General
Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,
while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of
the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new
landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when
his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a
deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the
embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.
He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an

economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies
while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35
countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to
reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,
and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become
more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of
American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling
between Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai
and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins
with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials
said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to
understand Pakistan's concerns. ""Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even
by those who may not like him,"" Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has
wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said,
General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply
more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and
Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S
was supposed to go to). Aside from loss of life, this is a major blow to Pakistan. I recommend that you call Qureshi,
Nawaz and Pasha (who will be here tomorrow). This will either break Pakistanis or will get them into the fight. This
shrine is deeply tied to the foundation of Islam in Pakistan.

Lessons from Aceh:
• MDFs encourage greater donor participation: Smaller donors joined
the Aceh fund because they wished to support reconstruction efforts but
lacked independent capacity and often did not have strong views on how
to pursue reconstruction. They wanted the Bank to assume fiduciary
responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take
a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities.
• Develop an outreach strategy: The Aceh MDF Secretariat developed an
Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to
meet and discuss with beneficiaries, and communication through
advertisements as well as a telephone hotline.
• Engage the government in dialogue: The Aceh MDF received praise
for engaging the GoI in policy dialogue. The MDF was an entry point for
engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.
• Appointment on Envoy: The appointment of a high-profile UN Special
Envoy (former President Clinton) increased the availability of funding

and willingness of international agencies to try new approaches. It also
could provide one forum for coordination among donors, if the Envoy's
office is adequately supported.
• Disaster prevention: The tsunami underscored the critical role of
disaster prevention in ""building back better."" It is difficult to
overemphasize the importance of embedding risk reduction into
recovery, especially in Haiti, where natural disasters have caused
enormous human suffering.
• Coordinate proliferating aid agencies: Large numbers of both public
and private aid agencies are likely be active in Haiti for some time. It is
important to develop effective coordinating mechanisms and work to
ensure that agencies bring actual expertise to the country, reduce turnover
of international staff, and seek staff with appropriate language skills.
• Authoritative Assessment: Authoritative joint assessments involving the
UN, the Red Cross, and national governments could have a beneficial
impact on the decision making process and ensure broad buy-in.

Cheryl
This came to me through a doctor friend of Harold's and mine. It is a pretty grim snapshot from a group of doctors ( I
think from Mt Sinai hospital in NY) who returned from Haiti late last week .Our friend, Michael Hausman, is a terrific
hand surgeon who was trying to get down there to help. I was reluctant to send this to you because I know how hard
you and many other people have been working to relieve suffering and that you and others are working round the
clock. Nonetheless I thought you might be interested in their impressions so I am sending it to you as a data point.
Please feel free to share this with others.

Thanks much appreciated.
I believe we went in with a reasonably comprehensive service we wanted to
provide acute trauma care in an orthopedic disaster. Our plan was to be at a
hospital where we could utilize our abilities as trauma surgeons treat the acute
injuries involved in an orthopaedic disaster. We expected many amputations
however came with a philosophy that would reasonably start limb salvage in what
we thought was a salvageable limb.
David Helfet put a team together which included:
2 orthopaedic trauma surgeons
3 orthopaedic trauma fellows
2 highly skilled anesthiologists
1 general surgery trauma surgeon
2 synthes reps who were also scrub techs
1 trauma nurse practioner to do triage
2 OR nurses
Our equipment including a huge amount of anesth medications and equipment,
ability to construct 150 ex fix both small and large, OR equipment including
scalpels etc, OR soft goods, splint material, OR prep material.
We also had a plan of physician and equipment replacemnt that was dynamic
where w/i 24hrs we could bring in what was necessary on the Synthes private jet.
We thought the plan was a good one.
We were incredibly naïve.
Disaster management on the ground was nonexistent. The difficulties in getting
in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and david helfet's
high political connections with Partner's in Health as well as the Clintons only
portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived.
We started out friday morning, got a slot to get in friday that was eventually
cancelled when we were on the runway to be rescheduled the next day. We
diverted to the DR and planned on arriving in P OP saturday.
Once on the ground the hospital we had intelligence that was up and running with
2 OR's General Hospital was included severely in the earthquake and not capable
of running functioning OR's as there was no running water and only a limited
electrical supply on generator.
We quickly took our second option
Community Hospital of Haiti. We found approx 750 pt in the hospital upon our
initial eval, the hospital had running water, electricity and 2 functional OR's
Our naivette did not expect that the 2 anesth machines would not work, there
would be 1 cautery for the hospital, autoclave that fit instruments the size of a
cigar box, no sterile saline, no functioning fluoro and no local staff only a ragtag

group of voluntary health providers who like us had made it there on there own,
To summarize we had no clue the medical infrastructure of the country was so
poor.
As we got up and running in the OR and organized the patients for surgery we
communicated our new needs back to Synthes and more supplies were loaded for
a second trip - these included battery operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of
saline, soft goods in the OR. This plane landed as planned sunday pm, equipment
was loaded on a truck and subsequent hijacked between the airport and the
hospital.
At the hospital we had zero security despite promises form NYPD and NYFD to
provide that to us.
Our philosophy was to work like this was a marathon run the OR's around the
clock with the idea that we would have a defined extraction time of llpm
tues. The plane that extracted us would come in with a new medical staff
compliment to replace us. Equipment included urgent things to maximize issues
that were nonexistent in the hospital that would enable us to provide better and
more efficient care:
2 portable anesth machines
2electrocautery
2 portable monitors for the pacu
2autoclaves
Replacement exfix
Things that didn't arive with the previous flight
That planes slot was cancelled by the military at 6am tues.
We also previously had seen daylight in the remaining patients monday night
haviving completed approx 100 surgeries. However on tues morning we found a
huge # of new patients. The hospital was forced to undergo lockdown closing its
gates to the outside and outside crowd becoming angry.
We also noted tues morning that many of the patients we were operating on were
becoming septic.
We finished operating at noon tues, the last surgery our group assisting an
obstetrician on a caesarian and resuscitating a baby that was not breathing.
We decided as a group the situation for us at the hospital was untenable supplies
were running out, team was exhauted, safety a huge concern, and no extraction
plan with resupply. We decided to make our way to airport thru the help of a
hospital benefactor. Jamaican soldiers with M-16 were necessary to escort us out
with our luggage as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital.
We made it to airport on back of a pickup track, got onto the tarmac, hailed a
commercial plane that carried cargo to montreal and had private jet pick us up
there.
The issues we were unprepared for and witnessed were
1. The amount of human devastation
2. The complete lack of a medical infrastructure in the country

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769503 Date: 08/31/2015
3. The lack of support of the haitian medical community
4. The complete lack of any organization on the ground. Noone was in charge,
we had the first functional up and running hospital in the P OP area yet noone and
I me NOONE came to the hospital to assess what we were doing, what we were
capable of doing and what we would need, to be more efficient. The fact that the
military could not or would not protect the resupply equipment on sunday or let
the tues flight come in says it all.
5. Lack of any security at all at the hospital
I would take away that disasters like this need organization on a much higher
level than we had with the clear involvement and approval of the military from
the beginning.
Currently there is Noone obviously running the show and care is in chaotic at
best. MD's are coming in country with no plan of what the are going to
do. Surgeons that expect to just show up and operate are delusional as to what
there role would be as without a complement of support staff and supplies they
would be of limited or no value.
'I hope this helps. We all felt as though we abandoned these patients and that
country and feel terrible. Our role now being back in NY is to expose the
inadequacies of the system to the media in the hopes of effecting a change in this
system immediatly. We feel that the only way to really help now is an urgent
programtic change and organization in the support of the medical staff on the
ground and what is critically needed to expeditiosly bring in.
Cherrios on the tarmac are not getting it done on these patients which clearly
would be savable if good care could urgently be provided.
Please share this email with everyone and anyone you find might help.
Good luck
Dean

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could
almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a
pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,
but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in
many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that
opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to
improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development
director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a
large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to
726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects
of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and
diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals
with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens
Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to
healthcare for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating
statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School
of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places
of worship more welcoming.
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,"" said Kim
Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer
for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that
people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to
the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on
the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working
Order, a FISA grantee.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work
that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of
working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order ""were of equal or greater
value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to
work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A new frontier is helping
young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,
was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next
decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search. committee. ""We know that we have found such a person in Kristy
Trautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the
board and the community.""

Some articles you may not have seen: 1. Anthony H. Cordesman's analysis, posted at CSIS, ""Israel as a
Strategy Liability?"" is being widely discussed and circulated; 2. Max Blumenthal, who is now reporting from
Israel, writing a book on the crisis of democracy there, details from the Israeli press how the raid was long
planned and who approved it, how the Netanyahu government is stirring up support, and the internal
consequences (see the detail on the Facebook page urging the assassination of an Israeli-Arab member of the
Knesset, and the actions of Bibi's allies); 3. David Ignatius's column today in the Washington Post, with detail
on how Turkey thought it was encouraged by Obama in its initiative with Brazil on Iran and then felt the limb
was cut off, among other things. I myself picked this up earlier from chatter among diplomats from Arab
countries in DC. True or not, distorted or accurate, it is what the Arabs believe. Their view is that Obama will
be reelected and there will be no progress at all in the Middle East for six years and they are planning
accordingly—US influence at ebb tide. Did any boys at the NSC encourage the Turks as reported? Better?
Worse? It's around and accepted as truth to the point that Ignatius reports it. 4. Leon Wieseltier, literary editor

Middle East [2]
America's ties to Israel are not based primarily on U.S. strategic interests. At the best of times, an Israeli
government that pursues the path to peace provides some intelligence, some minor advances in military
technology, and a potential source of stabilizing military power that could help Arab states like Jordan. Even
then, however, any actual Israeli military intervention in an Arab state could prove as destabilizing as
beneficial. The fact is that the real motives behind America's commitment to Israel are moral and ethical. They
are a reaction to the horrors of the Holocaust, to the entire history of Western anti-Semitism, and to the United
States' failure to help German and European Jews during the period before it entered World War II. They are a
product of the fact that Israel is a democracy that shares virtually all of the same values as the United States.
The U.S. commitment to Israel is not one that will be abandoned. The United States has made this repeatedly
clear since it first recognized Israel as a state, and it has steadily strengthened the scale of its commitments since
1967. The United States has provided Israel with massive amounts of economic aid and still provides enough
military assistance to preserve Israel's military superiority over its neighbors. The United States has made it
clear that any U.S. support for Arab-Israeli peace efforts must be based on options that preserve Israel's
security, and its recent announcements that it will consider ""extended regional deterrence"" are code words for a
U.S. commitment that could guard Israel, as well as its neighbors, against an Iranian nuclear threat.
At the same time, the depth of America's moral commitment does not justify or excuse actions by an Israeli
government that unnecessarily make Israel a strategic liability when it should remain an asset. It does not mean
that the United States should extend support to an Israeli government when that government fails to credibly
pursue peace with its neighbors. It does not mean that the United States has the slightest interest in supporting
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, or that the United States should take a hard-line position on Jerusalem that
would effectively make it a Jewish rather than a mixed city. It does not mean that the United States should be
passive when Israel makes a series of major strategic blunders--such as persisting in the strategic bombing of
Lebanon during the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, escalating its attack on Gaza long after it had achieved its key
objectives, embarrassing the U.S. president by announcing the expansion of Israeli building programs in east
Jerusalem at a critical moment in U.S. efforts to put Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track, or sending
commandos to seize a Turkish ship in a horribly mismanaged effort to halt the ""peace flotilla"" going to Gaza.
It is time Israel realized that it has obligations to the United States, as well as the United States to Israel, and
that it become far more careful about the extent to which it test the limits of U.S. patience and exploits the
support of American Jews. This does not mean taking a single action that undercuts Israeli security, but it does
mean realizing that Israel should show enough discretion to reflect the fact that it is a tertiary U.S. strategic
interest in a complex and demanding world.
Israel's government should act on the understanding that the long-term nature of the U.S.-Israel strategic
relationship will depend on Israel clearly and actively seeking peace with the Palestinians—the kind of peace
that is in Israel's own strategic interests. Israelis should understand that the United States opposes expansion
and retention of its settlements and its efforts to push Palestinians out of greater Jerusalem. Israeli governments
should plan Israeli military actions that make it clear that Israel will use force only to the level actually required,
that carefully consider humanitarian issues from the start, and that have a clear post-combat plan of action to
limit the political and strategic impact of its use of force. And Israel should not conduct a high-risk attack on
Iran in the face of the clear U.S. ""red light"" from both the Bush and Obama administrations. Israel should be
sensitive to the fact that its actions directly affect U.S. strategic interests in the Arab and Muslim worlds, and it
must be as sensitive to U.S. strategic concerns as the United States is to those of Israel.
The United States does not need unnecessary problems in one of the most troubled parts of the
world, particularly when Israeli actions take a form that does not serve Israel's own strategic interests. This
Israeli government in particular needs to realize that as strong as U.S.-Israel ties may be, it is time to return to
the kind of strategic realism exemplified by leaders like Yitzhak Rabin. No aspect of what happened this week
off the coast of Gaza can be blamed on Israeli commandos or the Israel Defense Forces. Israel's prime minister
and defense minister had full warning about the situation, and they knew the flotilla was deliberately designed
as a political provocation to capture the attention of the world's media in the most negative way possible. They

The Flotilla Raid Was Not ""Bungled."" The IDF Detailed Its Violent Strategy In Advance.
On 06.03.10, By Max Blumenthal
Tel Aviv-Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior ministers have attempted to blame army
commanders for ""the bungled raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla,"" according to the UK's Daily Telegraph. The AP reported that
""Israel's bloody, bungled takeover of a Gaza-bound Turkish aid vessel is complicating US-led Mideast peace efforts."" And
according to Reuters, ""Israeli military admits errors in bungled boarding.""
But was the raid really bungled? Did the Israeli military command and Netanyahu government have no clear strategy
going in? Or was the violence they meted out against the flotilla activists deliberate and methodically planned?
Statements by senior Israeli military commanders made in the Hebrew media days before the massacre revealed that the
raid was planned over a week in advance by the Israeli military and was personally approved by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Ehud Barak. The elite Israeli commando unit known as Unit 13 was tasked with
carrying out the mission and its role was known by the Israeli public well before the raid took place. Details of the plan
show that the use of deadly force was authorized and calculated. The massacre of activists should not have been
unexpected.
On May 28, three days before the raid, top Israeli military officials revealed details of their strategy to Maariv, Israel's most
widely circulated paper. The caption of the Maariv article reflected the military command's plan to use force: ""On the way
to violence; one of the boats is on its way.""
Here is a translation of relevant portions of the article:
Maariv, 5/28/10 P. 4
Title: Head to Head in the Heart of the Sea
Caption: On the way to violence; one of the boats is on its way.""
Subhead: The sea encounter that will occur at the end of the weekend is already planned detail by detail. From the
moment that the ships will pass the ""red line"" on their way to Gaza, the fighters of Unit 13 will take control and transfer 800
passengers from their boats back to where they came from. And special arrest units were set up.
From the body of article: This operation was approved by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Barak and will
be led by the commander of the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel Eliezer Maron, who is nicknamed ""Cheney."" If the people
aboard the boats will not agree to turn around, the operation will transfer to the stage of force. ""We are afraid that
there will be a terror attack by the boats,"" said a high ranking officer. ""If terrorists have gotten on the boats or if there is an

Israeli military that the, saYists might try to repel its commandos once they forced their way on the ships. The plan to
search for ""sabbiage materials"" also foreshadowed the IDF's post-raid propaganda campaign.
An alternative plan that would have been likely to avert violence could have been set into motion. The Israeli Navy could
have done what it had in the past and hijacked the aid ships without boarding them, then towed them to shore. However,
the Rambo-style plan concocted by Netanyahu, his top aides and the Naval commander with the unfortunate nickname of
""Cheney"" made the killing of activists likely, if not inevitable.
Why didn't Israel's leaders choose to deal with the flotilla in a more judicious fashion? Were they that stupid, or just crazy?
From the details of the plan it appears that Netanyahu and his cohorts had envisioned Entebbe Part Deux, a daring anti-
terror raid that would lift the sinking morale of the Israeli public while intimidating Iran and the Arab world. Though Israel
may be more isolated than ever as a result of the massacre, the Netanyahu administration is reaping considerable
political benefits at home.
The day after the massacre, spontaneous celebrations broke out in Ashdod, Tel Aviv, and throughout the country,
bringing together right-wing elements with everyday Israelis. Over a thousand Israelis gathered tonight outside the Turkish
embassy in Tel Aviv to rally against the Turkish government and express their support for the raid. Multiple demonstrators
including one man who has lived in Israel for 60 years told me, ""What Turkey [the sponsor of the Mavi Marmara boat] has
done is great. I have never seen this country more united in my entire life. We are all standing together now."" (Video
coming soon).
Israeli newscasters are routinely using the term ""mechabel,"" or terrorist, to refer to the flotilla activists, while the violence
that broke out on the deck of the Mavi Marmara is called ""the lynch."" (Nevermind that zero commandos were hung and
nine activists were killed, including an American citizen who was shot in the head four times.) No evidence is required to
support claims in the Israeli media. The public desperately wants to believe that its government is right, so much so that
Israel's media is not even making a token effort to challenge the increasingly hysterical press releases disseminated by
the IDF press office every few hours.
Hanin Zoabi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of the Knesset who was on the Mavi Marmara, was physically accosted in the
Knesset by fellow legislators for attempting to relate her experience aboard the flotilla. MK Miri Regev of Likud called her a
""traitor,"" while Yoel Hasson of Kadima, a supposedly centrist party, denounced Zoabi as a ""terrorist."" An Israeli Facebook
group devoted to inciting Zoabi's assassination has gathered 600 members in just a day and a half. In the meantime,
Israel's Interior Minster Eli Yishai is ""looking into"" means of stripping Zoabi of her citizenship.
This Friday, anti-occupation activists expect to encounter intense violence from the Israeli Army and Border Police at the
weekly demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah and Nebi Salah. ""In this atmosphere, you can expect with pretty reasonable
certainty that the soldiers Will go crazy,"" a veteran of the Sheikh Jarrah protest movement told me.
With two more ships on their way towards Gaza with aid for the besieged civilian population, the Israeli military and
Netanyahu administration are not wasting time in hatching a new strategy to stop them. Once again, the plan calls for
violence and possibly more death. ""Next time we'll use more force,"" a top Naval commander told the Jerusalem Post. ""We
will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war.""

The U.S. needs to keep nudging Israel on a Gaza fix
By David Ignatius
Friday, June 4,2010; A19
The Obama administration, caught between two allies during this week of crisis, has signaled Israel and Turkey
that the blockade of Gaza should be loosened to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the Palestinian
population there.
From the first news early Monday of the Israeli commando attack on a flotilla of Turkish relief ships, the White
House has been trying to balance the interests of two prickly friends. The immediate aim, said a senior official,
has been to ""defuse the electricity of the moment"" by freeing the ships' passengers and passing a U.N. resolution
calling (in fuzzy language) for an investigation of the raid.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769651 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769651 Date: 08/31/2015
Beyond crisis management, administration officials have begun to urge Israel to use this incident to untangle the
Gaza mess. U.S. officials hope Israel will take action on its own, before international condemnation grows any
louder or another relief convoy tests the blockade. ""The humanitarian aperture is not wide enough,"" argues the
U.S. official. ""We need to convince the Israelis that not everything can be made into a weapon.""
The Obama team recognizes that Israel will act in its interests, but it wants Jerusalem to consider U.S. interests,
as well. The administration has communicated at a senior level its fear that the Israelis sometimes ""care about
their equities, but not about ours.""
This cautionary message -- that Israel must act as a more reliable and responsible partner -- may be the most
important one conveyed this week.
One issue on which the administration believes Israel would benefit from a more farsighted view is the
investigation of the incident. Israel has argued that this is a purely internal matter for the Israeli military, whose
operations to enforce the Gaza blockade were lawful and appropriate.
But by defying calls for an international inquiry, the Israelis will compound their isolation. ""They have an
image problem, a perception problem,"" says the U.S. official. The White House hopes the Israelis will embrace
some mechanism for an international probe -- perhaps a French proposal for an inquiry by the International
Committee of the Red Cross. Such a move would be in Israel's interest, the administration believes.
The trickiest problem in the first hours of the crisis was dealing with Turkey, whose leaders treated the
commando raid as a pirate attack on Turkish citizens. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gen. Jim
Jones, the national security adviser, met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Then came a lengthy
phone call between President Obama and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Obama told Erdogan that ""we need to find a solution"" for the Gaza humanitarian problem, according to a U.S.
official. Erdogan is said to have agreed with the president that a good relationship between Israel and Turkey
was crucial for regional stability -- and that Turkey didn't want to see any further degradation.
The Obama administration deserves credit for its repair work in the first days after the Gaza attack. But this is
another example where the administration has been reacting to events that it should have tried better to control.
The Gaza confrontation has been developing for weeks; administration officials reportedly cautioned Israel
about provocative moves, but not emphatically enough to make a difference. U.S. officials were blindsided
about the commando operation partly because they don't spy on a key ally.
Similarly, the Obama White House has been too reactive in its relationship with Turkey. A glaring example of
this diplomatic drift is the Turkish mediation effort with Iran to revive an October plan for enrichment of
uranium abroad. Davutoglu thought he had Obama's blessing for his shuttle diplomacy, and the White House
was given frequent updates. But when Turkey and Brazil announced they had clinched the deal, the
administration did the diplomatic equivalent of shrugging its shoulders -- and went ahead with plans for U.N.
sanctions.
One of the perverse secrets of Middle East diplomacy is the importance of riding several horses at once. In the
heyday of Henry Kissinger's shuttle mediation, the Americans were the supreme masters of playing both sides
of the street.
Obama has been talking about engagement and mediation but without much to show for it. Instead, the
administration has been responding to events rather than driving them. That won't do. As former ambassador
Chas. W. Freeman says in his collection of aphorisms, ""The Diplomat's Dictionary"": ""If you're not at the table,
you're on the menu.""

Operation Make the World Hate Us
The assault on the 'Mavi Marmara' was wrong, and a gift to Israel's enemies.

Israel does not need enemies: it has itself. Or more precisely: it has its government. The Netanyahu-Barak
government has somehow found a way to lose the moral high ground, the all-important war for symbols and
meanings, to Hamas. That is quite an accomplishment. Operation Make the World Hate Us, it might have been
called.
I leave it to others to make the operational criticisms of the Israeli action, and will say only that even my
amateurish understanding of the tactical challenge posed by the interdiction of the boats suffices to suggest that
there were other ways to do this. I also will not pretend to a perfect grasp of what happened on board the Mavi
Marmara. I have pondered the videos that both sides have released, and concluded that the Israeli soldiers
sliding down that rope had no intention of attacking the people on board and that the people on board had no
way of being confident of this. I cannot expect Palestinians and their supporters to believe the best about the
Israeli army. (This is what Israeli hardliners call ""the restoration of deterrence."") I do not doubt that some of the
activists on the ship welcomed a confrontation with Israel, but the Israelis should not have obliged them. In any
event, what took place on that deck looks to me like a tragic misunderstanding. Yet there was no reason to think
that anything else would have transpired.
The important point is that the killing of civilians on the Mavi Marmara—I understand that they were ""armed""
with metal bars and a knife, but still they were civilians, and soldiers are trained to respond unlethally to the
recklessness of a mob—cannot be extenuated by reference to ""asymmetrical warfare"" and Israel's right to
defend itself. This was not warfare, at least of the physical sort. Israel was not under attack. A headline in The
Washington Post yesterday reported that ""Israel says Free Gaza Movement poses threat to Jewish state."" Such a
claim is absurd. It is true that the movement has grown in recent years, and is now troublesome to Israel's
policy in Gaza; and it is also true that the Turkish charity that sponsored the ""Freedom Flotilla"" has ties to
Islamicist groups. But this is hardly what Israel likes to call, in the Iranian context, and there quite plausibly, an
""existential threat."" The extension of the definition of a security threat to include hostile activities that have
little or no bearing upon security is an ominous development.
It is also the inevitable consequence of Benjamin Netanyahu's cunning pronouncement last year that Israel is
now endangered by ""the Iran threat, the missile threat, and the threat I call the Goldstone threat."" The
equivalence was morally misleading, and therefore dangerous. Ideological warfare is not military warfare. I
have studied the entirety of the Goldstone Report, and whereas I do not doubt (and wrote in this magazine in the
days before Goldstone) that Operation Cast Lead caused the unjustifiable death of non-combatants, I also do not
doubt that the Goldstone Report, which was nastily indifferent to Israel's security predicament and to the ethical
challenges of Israeli self-defense, was an instrument in a broad campaign of delegitimation against Israel—and
yet the threat of delegitimation is not like the threat of destruction. It is different in kind. A commando
operation is not an appropriate response to an idea. ""This was no Love Boat,"" Netanyahu said yesterday. ""It was
a hate boat."" He is right, but so what? The threat of delegitimation is not a military problem and it does not have
a military solution. And the attempt to give it a military solution has now had the awful consequence of making
the threat still greater. The assault on the Mavi Marmara was a stupid gift to the delegitimators.
You do not have to be a general to grasp these distinctions. In fact, judging by Israel's recent history, it might
help not to be one. But the militarization of the Israeli government's understanding of Israel's situation—this
has been the most sterile period for diplomacy in all of Israel's history—is not all that led to the debacle at sea.
Rules of military engagement that allow soldiers to fire on political activists (I leave aside the question of their
humanitarianism for a moment) may signify something still deeper and even more troubling. It is hard not to
conclude from this Israeli action, and also from other Israeli actions in recent years, that the Israeli leadership
simply does not care any longer about what anybody thinks. It does not seem to care about what even the
United States—its only real friend, even in the choppy era of Obama—thinks. This is not defiance, it is despair.
The Israeli leadership seems to have given up any expectation of fairness and sympathy from the world. It is
behaving as if it believes, in the manner of the most perilous Jewish pessimism, that the whole world hates the
Jews, and that is all there is to it. This is the very opposite of the measured and empirical attitude, the search for

The complication—the one that deprives anybody who acknowledges it of membership in any of the gangs of
commentary—is that there is a partial basis in the actually existing world for a degree of Israeli pessimism.
There are leaders, states, organizations, and peoples whose hostility to the Jewish state is irrational and absolute
and in some cases murderous. Things are said critically about Israel that wildly burst the bounds of thoughtful
criticism. The language in which Israel is described by some governments and international organizations is
lurid and grotesque and foul. Anti-Semitic tropes—the conspiracy theory about the Jews, most conspicuously—
are regularly encountered in otherwise respectable places. The analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that
absolves the Palestinians of any significant role in it is widespread. I do not see how any of this can be denied,
or shunted aside, or explained entirely in terms of Israeli behavior. But it is emphatically not the whole picture,
except for those Israelis and Jews whose political interests and ideological inclinations prefer it to be the whole
picture. For there are forces in Israel, and in its government, that have a use for Jewish hopelessness.
There is a verse in Numbers that Jewish pessimists like to cite: ""the people shall dwell alone, and not be
reckoned among the nations."" It is Balaam's divinely inspired description of the Israelites—Balaam, who came
to curse and stayed to bless. But I have always regarded it as a curse, this promise of loneliness. I have heard it
intoned lachrymosely and proudly—in our time Jewish pride has a disturbingly parasitic relationship with
Jewish lachrymosity—all my life. It chills me to the bone. It is a locution for prophets, not prime ministers. The
Jews cannot dwell alone. In fact, their history shows that they never did dwell alone. It is not a tale of insularity
and isolation. The apartness of the Jews was never a complete secession from their environment. The
engagement of the Jews with the world was a matter not only of practical necessity, but also of theological
conviction. And not even the darkest and most dire adversity succeeded in driving them entirely into
themselves.
When, in the modern era, the Zionists concluded, quite correctly, that the Jews must extract themselves from
anti-Semitic societies and establish a society of their own, a sovereign one, in the land of Israel, it was in part to
""normalize"" them by making them ""reckoned among the nations,"" and therefore like other nations. Zionism was
a reversal of Balaam's phony blessing. The state was not supposed to be a bunker, even if it had enemies. But
Netanyahu is a creature of the bunker. He talks about peace, but not like a man who hungers for it. He takes no
steps toward peace except as the consequence of a crisis—a crisis not with the Palestinians but with the
Americans. He liturgically intones his warnings, some of them true, about the external dangers facing Israel,
and mistakes brutishness for toughness, and offers nothing. He is a gray, muddling, reactive figure. His
preferred strategy for his country is: one quiet week after another unto eternity. His problem is that there are not
many quiet weeks.
But about those activists: a great deal of bathetic rubbish has been written about them. Insofar as they were
bringing food and medicine to Gaza, they were humanitarians; but insofar as they were striking a blow for the
government of Gaza, they were anti-humanitarians. A real ""Freedom Flotilla"" would have sailed for Gaza to
liberate it from its rulers. For Hamas stifles Gaza from within even as Israel stifles it from without. It oppresses
the Palestininans who live under its sway and has brought them ruin. When did it become progressive to support
a theocracy? Consider the case of Henning Mankell, the Swedish writer of thrillers (and the son-in-law of
Ingmar Bergman) who was a passenger on one of the boats in the ""Freedom Flotilla."" In his youth he took part
in anti-Vietnam and anti-apartheid demonstrations, presumably in the spirit of secular reason. For a while he
lived in Norway and participated in the activities of a radical Maoist party: let us call that secular unreason.
Now he does the work of Hamas and its mullahs. Last year Mankell attended the Palestine Festival of Literature
in east Jerusalem—or would have attended it, if the Israeli authorities had not idiotically closed it down. When
he returned to Sweden, he wrote that ""there is a straight line between Soweto, Sharpeville, and what recently
happened [I presume he was referring to the war] in Gaza."" And: ""Is it strange that some [Palestinians] in pure
desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really. Maybe it
is strange that there are not more of them."" And: ""The state of Israel in its current form has no future. Moreover,
those who advocate a two-state solution have not got it right. ... The question is whether it will be possible to
talk sense into the Israelis in order for them to willingly accept the end of their own apartheid state."" This man
has rights, at sea and on land, but he can hardly be lauded as a champion of peace and reconciliation. You are
not for co-existence if you advocate the disappearance of one of the terms. (Consider, analogously, the recent
adventures of Noam Chomsky in the region. It was widely noted that the Israelis, again idiotically, turned him
away at the Allenby Bridge. It was less widely noted that a few days later a reporter for The New York Times

accidentally discovered him in Lebanon at the home of Nabil Qaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah, which is
not what Voltaire had in mind.)
And yet the screw must be turned again: the anti-Israeli virulence of Henning Mankell and his maritime
comrades does not make Israel's assault on the Mavi Marmara more just or more wise. Now the Israeli
government may find it impossible not to modify or even to lift the blockade of Gaza—an outcome that no
decent person can decry, as long as Hamas does not exploit the respite to acquire weapons or what it needs to
make them, and the past is not encouraging in this regard. Netanyahu will do what he can to get past the mess,
hoping that the approach of the midterm elections in the United States will rescue him from the pressure, and
the deadening hand of the status quo will be back. And Israel will be known to more and more people—in a
wounding misrepresentation—mainly for cruelty.

To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristofs column could have been written by the peacemaking Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin or Israel's founder
and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, if they were alive today.
Mr. Rabin told me shortly before he was assassinated by a right-wing Israeli extremist that Israel, while pursuing peace,
must never play into the hands of Palestinian terrorists, who would try to sabotage the talks with attacks intended to
provoke disproportionate retaliation. Yes, Israel would fight the terrorists, but not the Palestinian people. And it would
certainly not initiate bloody conflict.
Mr. Ben-Gurion told me that Israel would regret maintaining control of Arab-inhabited regions and another people after the
1967 Six-Day War. He said the war would never end as long as Israel occupied the area, an occupation he felt was both
strategically and morally wrong.
And if succeeding right-wing governments had taken his advice, the war might well have been over years ago, preventing
Hamas from ruling Gaza, giving Iran no excuse for threatening Israel with nuclear destruction, and making life much
easier for the United States.
The Israeli assault on the pro-Palestinian flotilla is a symbolic result of the tragic survival-imperiling refutation by Israeli
right-wingers of the visionary views of their country's two greatest leaders.

JOINT STATEMENT
BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
CALLING ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT
TO FULFIL ITS HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS
The United States and the European Union condemn the continuing human rights violations in Iran since the June
12 election. The large scale detentions and mass trials, the threatened execution of protestors, the intimidation of
family members of those detained and the continuing denial to its citizens of the right to peaceful expressiIon are
contrary to human rights norms.
Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned
by the potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of
the Islamic Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international
human rights obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed
the abuses and to release those who are exercising their rights.

OBAMA: They're great. Hillary Clinton is an amazing secretary of State. I mean she would have been an amazing

approach. And we're seeing the outcome of that on the international stage. I think, you know, we can say pretty clearly
that the United States -- the -- the view of this nation around the world has changed. People are enthusiastic about the
potential. Things aren't perfect. We're still a nation fighting two wars. But when we travel around the country, the

our secretary of State.

An FT interview with Hillary Clinton
By Daniel Dombey
FT
June 11 2010 22:21
This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed
streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that
has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most
exciting for a generation - had never ended.
But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not
South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what
the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might
suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of
US leadership, one very much built around herself.
She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall
tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised
arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.
In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays
that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while
Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a
born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and
local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.
Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it
to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -
and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed
bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a
quarter of a million miles since taking office.
On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four
countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a
shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we
don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.
So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,
talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.
""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister
or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her
expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a
vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of
leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.""
She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration
- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a
battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is
ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the
foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -
go beyond that.
Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies,
toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and
for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we
had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.""
As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
""chunky"".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""
State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just
expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women
have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right"".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run
inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the
Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is
based on her performance in the job.""
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines.""
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he
calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your
audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day.""
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to
Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said,"" he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""
""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.
""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US
official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?""
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.
Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.

David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.

Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close""
A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy.""

David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

An FT interview with Hillary Clinton
By Daniel Dombey
FT
June 11 2010 22:21
This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed
streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that
has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most
exciting for a generation - had never ended.
But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not
South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what
the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might
suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of
US leadership, one very much built around herself.
She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall
tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised
arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.
In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays
that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while
Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a
born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and
local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.
Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it
to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -
and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed
bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a
quarter of a million miles since taking office.
On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four
countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a
shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we
don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.
So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,
talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.
""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her
expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a
vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of
leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.""
She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration
- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a
battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is
ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the
foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -
go beyond that.
Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies,
toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and
for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we
had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.""
As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
""chunky"".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""
State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just

expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women
have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right"".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run
inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the
Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is
based on her performance in the job.""
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines.""
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he
calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your
audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day.""
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to
Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said,"" he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""
""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.
""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US
official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?""
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.

Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.
Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent
David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.

Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close""
A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015

campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy.""
Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist
David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

Hillary, as promised, I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put
together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai
whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay on
a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it
sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce, Martin and I will be open to other NY/DC
possibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.

Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
""Hey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?""
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too ""Gucci."" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it.""
With that, he's out the door.
""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides.
""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay.""
The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?""
""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?""
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want the
American people to understand,"" he announced in March 2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minute
photo op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.""
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure.""
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling an
unsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.
Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a ""bleeding ulcer."" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is going
to end in an argument.""
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gucci"" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
""He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me.""
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,""
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannot
by itself create governance reform.""
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'""
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.""
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" he groans. ""I
don't even want to open it."" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos.""
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'""
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""He's been locked up in his
palace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!""
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the Hudson,"" as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and
""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'd
end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: ""The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.""
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We really
felt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.""
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. ""He was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.""
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens""
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president.
""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""golden
boy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fucking
lads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.""
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'""
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number of
people,"" McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math,"" as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while,"" says one U.S. official, ""the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint,"" a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
""I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,"" Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you,"" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. ""These were abandoned houses,"" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,"" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck, when I came over here and
heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,"" says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing.""
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well,"" McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.
""Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,"" says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,"" he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year,"" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do, either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,"" McChrystal tries to joke.
""But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,"" one soldier says.
""Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,"" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.""
""I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,"" the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting.""
""I agree with you,"" McChrystal says. ""In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?""
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. ""That's the way this game is,"" McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts.""
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier,"" he tells
them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,"" he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical, politically,"" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there.""
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development,"" the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier.""
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first
impressions,"" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many
lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable,"" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future.""
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,""
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here,"" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress,""
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation,"" says a
U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
""The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,"" says a military official. ""We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
""This looks like CT-plus!"" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,"" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

The Runaway General
Stanley McChrystal, Obama's top commander in Afghanistan,
has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the
real enemy: The wimps in the White House
By Michael Hastings
Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT
This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.
'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?"" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
""The dinner comes with the position, sir,"" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
""Hey, Charlie,"" he asks, ""does this come with the position?""
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the ""most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine."" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too ""Gucci."" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
""What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?"" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
""We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,"" Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
""I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,"" McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
""Unfortunately,"" he adds, ""no one in this room could do it.""
With that, he's out the door.
""Who's he going to dinner with?"" I ask one of his aides.
""Some French minister,"" the aide tells me. ""It's fucking gay.""

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
""shortsighted,"" saying it would lead to a state of ""Chaos-istan."" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. ""I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,"" he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that?""
""Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""Did you say: Bite Me?""
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. ""I want the
American people to understand,"" he announced in March 2009. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan."" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. ""It was a 10-minute
photo op,"" says an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.""
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
""surge"" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed ""COINdinistas"" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of ""mission failure.""
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. ""I found that time painful,"" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. ""I was selling an
unsellable position."" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. ""The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,"" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. ""The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words ""victory"" or ""win,"" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a ""bleeding ulcer."" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. ""It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win,"" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. ""This is going
to end in an argument.""
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the ""least Gucci"" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
""He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,"" she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for ""I Suck at Fighting"" or ""In Sandals and Flip-Flops."") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention.""Afghanistan!"" they bellow.""Afghanistan!"" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. ""All these men,"" he tells me. ""I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me.""
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. ""It jeopardizes the mission,""
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. ""The military cannot
by itself create governance reform.""
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a ""clown"" who remains ""stuck in 1985."" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
""turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful."" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. ""Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review,"" says an adviser. ""She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'""
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. ""The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal,"" says a member of the general's team. ""Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.""
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. ""Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,"" he groans. ""I
don't even want to open it."" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
""Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,"" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. ""In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight,"" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as ""not an adequate strategic partner,"" and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be ""sufficient"" to deal with Al Qaeda. ""We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves,"" Eikenberry warned, ""short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos.""
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. ""I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before,"" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt ""betrayed"" by the leak. ""Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'""
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. ""He's been locked up in his
palace the past year,"" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. ""General,"" he called out to McChrystal, ""I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!""
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The ""Prison on the Hudson,"" as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called ""rat fucking,"" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. ""It was pretty out of control,"" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls ""huge talent"" and
""wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,"" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
""century man."" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. ""I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,"" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In ""Brinkman's Note,"" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: ""The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.""
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. ""We really
felt we were a peacetime generation,"" he recalls. ""There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.""
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. ""He was very focused,"" says Annie. ""Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.""
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous ""stuff happens""
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. ""If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public,"" he wrote, it could cause ""public embarrassment"" for the president.
""The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,"" wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the ""golden
boy"" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a ""political swamp,"" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a ""Jedi"" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (""There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. ""The fucking

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
lads love Stan McChrystal,"" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. ""You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.""
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. ""JSOC was a killing machine,"" says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. ""The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,"" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. ""He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'""
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. ""You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,"" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, ""I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though."" In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. ""We've shot an amazing number of
people,"" McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's ""insurgent math,"" as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. ""For a while,"" says one U.S. official, ""the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident."" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for ""courageous restraint,"" a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. ""Bottom line?"" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.""
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
""I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,"" Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: ""I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own."" Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. ""He started to look up to you,"" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. ""These were abandoned houses,"" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. ""Nobody was coming back to live in them.""
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. ""Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,"" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. ""Does that make any fucking sense?"" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. ""We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?""
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. ""Fuck, when I came over here and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,"" says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. ""I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing.""
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. ""I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well,"" McChrystal begins. ""How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?"" McChrystal says.
""Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,"" says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. ""Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,"" he tells the men. ""You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside."" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. ""We are knee-deep in the decisive year,"" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — ""but I don't think we do, either."" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. ""This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,"" McChrystal tries to joke.
""But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.""
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,"" one soldier says.
""Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,"" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. ""The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.""
""I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,"" the soldier persists. ""You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting.""
""I agree with you,"" McChrystal says. ""In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?""
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. ""That's the way this game is,"" McChrystal says. ""It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts.""
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. ""There's no way I can make that easier,"" he tells
them. ""No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you."" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. ""Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,"" he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. ""It's all very cynical, politically,"" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. ""Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there.""
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word ""progress"" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. ""There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development,"" the president says. ""As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier.""
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. ""It was one of our first
impressions,"" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. ""So many
lights shining brightly."" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. ""They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable,"" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. ""That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future.""
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. ""If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,""
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. ""There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here,"" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of ""progress,""
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a ""rising tide of security."" The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. ""This isn't a classic operation,"" says a
U.S. military official. ""It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in."" Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
""The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,"" says a military official. ""We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population."" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
""This looks like CT-plus!"" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. ""Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,"" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. ""A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers"" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word ""victory"" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

Judith —
This is simply a quick note to thank you for the inscribed Mongolian-language copy of Secretary Clinton's memoir which
just arrived. We look forward to delivering it to President Elbegdorj and know that he will be delighted. This was a
terrific idea on your part — and the fact that it now has actually happened is really gratifying as well.
FYI, let me also attach a copy of a recent letter from President Elbegdorj to former President Bill Clinton. Although
specifically highlighting the upcoming Nadaam festivities in Ulaanbaatar in mid July, I know that President Clinton would
be welcome to visit Mongolia at any time, fulfilling the desire expressed in his ""Foreign Policy"" interview earlier this year
that he really does want to ""ride across the Mongolian steppes on horseback""!
Best regards,
Jonathan

Besides, she'll answer this on camera tomorrow
I would however add Petreaus to her call sheet even though I'm sure she saw him at the WH, so we can reinforce her

Bill Clinton to U.S. soccer team: ""You are amazing!""
By Joe Conason

AP/Michael Sohn
Former President Bill Clinton at the World Cup group C soccer match between the United States and Algeria in Pretoria,
South Africa on Wednesday
Salon's Joe Conason is traveling with Bill Clinton in Africa this week and was with the former president at today's U.S.
World Cup soccer game in Pretoria. He filed this report:
Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria,
Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former
president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.
After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: ""I'm proud of you
because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!""
Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to
believe they had done it.
The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with
a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse
voice.
As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players
chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of
Team USA.
Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens.
""If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,"" he said. ""It was a great game. You
know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good
heads and good hearts.""</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770006 Date: 08/31/2015

This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him
everything. He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.
This is not a good turn of events.

Dear Melanne,
It has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian Catholic
University. It is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions have taken a stand

in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is business. The
approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of government,
administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the freedom of the
press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-student
came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their parents
will loose their jobs.
There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004
before the election could be next.
The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what she
can in our defense.
2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal,
CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the truth is
invaluable.
We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have to be
ready for everything.
Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.
May God bless you!
Fr. Borys

representatives of ""embattled NGOs"" in the balcony of the Slowacki Theater, and many were literally awe-struck. They
told me that it was the most important, most inspirational speech they had ever heard relating to civil society. I agree.
I realize that considerable behind-the-scenes work goes into a speech like this. While civil society has an important role
in critiquing governmental actions, I also think that it's important to recognize the efforts of our remarkable colleagues
in government. So please allow me to say ""thank you"" to you and your team. Please also know that you can count on
ICNL to redouble its efforts - within the CD Working Group and otherwise - to advance the objectives set forth in
Krakow. Indeed, I've already met with the Working Group and have reached out to other partners to ensure that civil
society properly complements the tireless efforts you and your team have displayed in protecting civic space around the

Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: ""Clinton isn't relevant and

Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet
with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the
two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media
together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair
House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in
the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an
impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the
construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA
Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is
divided over this issue.

Re: The Downing Street meeting today
Today a seven hour meeting took place at Downing Street to attempt to determine Gordon's
strategy. The participants were Gordon, Shaun, Peter, Alastair Campbell, and Ed Balls (who is
close to Gordon).
1. Gordon has made a maximum proposal to Clegg through intermediaries, including a
referendum on proportional representation, program, cabinet slots if Clegg wants them, or
not if he prefers to be perceived as above dealmaking. The offer is open, too, and can be
added to. Gordon is letting Cameron and Clegg have their conversation without going
public. Clegg in private is in something of a state of shock. He actually expected to win
about 125 seats—and finished at 57, losing 14 from what the Lib-Dems held. While
Clegg is out front he cannot make a deal on his own; he requires his party's backing.
Gordon and his people are in touch with people close to Clegg. Many of Clegg's senior
people will not support the deal that Cameron has proposed. Vincent Cable, Clegg's
number two, the shadow chancellor, is unhappy with the Tory deal. Clegg is therefore at
sea. Clegg's party base, moreover, would not approve a deal that did not represent a
""progressive"" position. Much of the Lib-Dem base is idealistic and subject to
disillusionment.
2. Gordon is doing whatever he can to hold on to power. Shaun, for his part, is working on
an economic package for Northern Ireland to win support from the DUP and other parties
for Labour—a package to be proposed in the Queen's Speech. Peter floats in and out of
the meeting and appears on TV. Alastair has emerged as a stalwart, providing Gordon
with talking points and practical ideas hour by hour.
3. The Tories are working overtime to foster the atmosphere that Gordon is repudiated and
should leave. This perception is gaining ground as the Cameron-Clegg talks go on.
Cameron seems to be dragging them out in order to undermine Gordon.
4. The outcome is highly uncertain largely because Clegg is between a rock and a hard
place within his own party. More to come later...

Tensions between Eikenberry, McChrystal will be focus of their
Washington visit
By Joshua Partlow
Sunday, May 9,2010; A01
They are both decorated generals, West Point graduates who studied at Harvard University and earnest
taskmasters who would rather work than sleep.
The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, and the top U.S. military commander there, Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal, assumed their posts amid lofty expectations that they could re-create the hand-in-glove
partnership that Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker had while leading the war effort in
Iraq.
But the Eikenberry-and-McChrystal team that returns to Washington this week, alongside Afghan President
Hamid Karzai, has a much different dynamic.
Both men said in interviews that they enjoy a productive relationship and have built stronger bonds between
troops and civilians across Afghanistan. Still, they have had significant disagreements over the course of the
Afghanistan war and have struggled to align their visions for how to work with Karzai's government, according
to interviews with U.S., NATO and Afghan officials.
Few critics suggest that those differences have harmed U.S. interests in Afghanistan. People who have worked
with both men said, however, that clear tensions exist at the top of the Obama administration's most important
military and foreign policy endeavor.
At times their differences over strategy have been public, particularly after two of Eikenberry's cables to
Washington last year were leaked to the news media. The cables warned that McChrystal's request for new
troops might be counterproductive as Karzai was ""not an adequate strategic partner."" McChrystal's staff

members were particularly upset that they weren't made aware of Eikenberry's position before he sent the cables
to Washington, they said in interviews.
Eikenberry has resisted some of McChrystal's wartime experiments. The ambassador refused to release funds to
expand a military effort to turn villagers into armed guards. He opposed one Army brigade's plan to form an
anti-Taliban alliance with a Pashtun tribe and funnel it development money. He criticized the military's proposal
to buy generators and diesel fuel for the energy-starved city of Kandahar and supported a longer-term
hydroelectric dam project.
Their views have diverged despite shared experience: Eikenberry served 18 months as the NATO commander
in Afghanistan, the job McChrystal now holds, before retiring from the military and returning as ambassador.
As McChrystal has overhauled the war strategy, some of the legacy he is undoing is Eikenberry's.
Eikenberry wanted to become NATO's senior civilian representative, in addition to his job as ambassador, but
McChrystal recommended against it, according to diplomats in Kabul. A British diplomat, Mark Sedwill, got
the job.
""You have two generals of similar rank who don't agree on the policy, who apparently don't like each other. It
makes for a difficult relationship,"" said Peter W. Galbraith, who served as the top U.S. official in the United
Nations' mission to Afghanistan during last year's contested presidential election.
Both men have tried to dispel notions that they disagree on strategy and don't get along.
""The best metaphor I can give you is of an athletic team,"" Eikenberry said. ""We play different positions. We
have different but complementary roles. Of course, sometimes we're going to disagree on what's the best play to
call, but we're absolutely committed as teammates to see the president's strategy is well-executed.""
McChrystal said that he and Eikenberry cooperate effectively and that their relationship should not be measured
against the Petraeus-Crocker pairing in Iraq.
""We've known each other for many years. We talk through all the things we deal with,"" McChrystal said. ""Some
people are looking for an Iraq model. But Iraq wasn't a 46-nation coalition.""
Civil-military integration
The two generals first crossed professional paths in 2002, when McChrystal, who had worked as chief of staff
under Gen. Dan K. McNeill, then coalition commander, helped prepare Eikenberry for a job in Kabul building
the fledgling Afghan National Army. Later, McChrystal ran the Joint Special Operations Command when
Eikenberry held the top military job in Afghanistan.
They now work more independently because their roles aren't perfectly aligned, they said, with McChrystal in
charge of the 130,000-strong NATO coalition, not just the American contingent.
Some disagreements between the men may reflect growing pains, as the military makes room for what has
become the second-largest U.S. embassy in the world, after the one in Iraq. When-President °barna took office
last year, there were 360 American civilians in Afghanistan. Now there are more than 1,000 and counting, the
most rapid growth of a U.S. civilian mission since the Vietnam War.
Military field commanders who once may have had political advisers now share authority with co-equal civilian
representatives backed by growing staffs. The result is a more forceful civilian voice in decision-making.

When Eikenberry has resisted a military proposal, the rationale is often that he does not want to undermine the
Afghan government and the development of its security forces. He says that he must take into account factors
beyond short-term stability and that programs without Afghan government ownership won't be sustainable.
""I think that both of us are very proud of the degree of civil-military integration we've been able to achieve in
the year that we've been here together,"" Eikenberry said. ""So, of course, there's going to be different
perspectives, there's going to be robust debates, and you really want that. You've got to encourage that.""
Divided over Karzai
Perhaps the most visible difference in approach is how the men work with Karzai.
McChrystal has adopted a role akin to chief diplomat, building a close partnership with Karzai. In monthly
White House review sessions, McChrystal has argued that U.S. officials should show more public deference to
Karzai, who he frequently reminds others is ""the elected leader of a sovereign country,"" administration officials
said.
In the interview, McChrystal called Karzai a ""great partner"" who has been ""absolutely straightforward with me
and been reliable.""
Some officials said he has built his relationship with Karzai at the expense of candor. In some instances, he has
chosen a less politically controversial path, U.S. officials said, citing his decision to work with Ahmed Wali
Karzai, the president's half brother, rather than stress his alleged criminal activity.
""If I don't have credibility with President Karzai, then I think I can't be an effective commander here,""
McChrystal said. ""And it doesn't mean just getting along with him and telling him what he wants to hear. It's
convincing him that I'm being a reliable and honest interlocutor with him.""
Eikenberry, meanwhile, has had to deliver tougher messages about corruption and governance that often upset
Karzai, and his rapport with the mercurial president has seemed to suffer.
During a lengthy policy review in the fall, Eikenberry argued against sending additional U.S. troops to
Afghanistan. And U.S. officials said he continues to think that the United States should find other Afghan
figures, including provincial leaders, to work with rather than rely so heavily on Karzai. Eikenberry's position
infuriated Karzai, who often views U.S. support for ""sub-national governments"" in Afghanistan as a threat to his
authority.
Karzai is a cunning politician who has tried to play Eikenberry and McChrYstal off each other and exploit any
political differences, U.S. officials said. In recent months, when Karzai has come under U.S. pressure to reform
his corrupt government, he has often lashed out publicly.
Since McChrystal took command in June, he has met Karzai more than 45 times, mostly one-on-one, including
a regular Sunday morning chat in the presidential palace. In an effort to present Karzai as commander in chief,
McChrystal has flown him across the country on five ""battlefield circulations.""
McChrystal has done more than his predecessors, including Eikenberry, to minimize civilian casualties, such as
restricting the use of air power and night raids. He has regularly apologized to Karzai for civilian deaths and
shown him video and slide presentations to explain how such mistakes occur.

""He was the first military man to really show that he respected and would respond to Karzai's agenda, civilian
casualties, of course, being the biggest issue,"" one senior NATO official said. ""In a sense, Karzai said, 'Here's a
soldier that finally I can deal with.'""
Crocker, the former U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, said he and Petraeus rarely differed over policy or approach
and carefully calibrated their relationship with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki, another, complicated
leader. The two almost always saw Maliki together. When meeting him alone, they would brief each other
before and after.
Of McChrystal and Eikenberry, Crocker said: ""They need to resolve any differences among themselves or take
it back to Washington because the stakes in Afghanistan are too great not to have a unified effort.""

Latest from Nairobi. Glenn is political counselor there.
1. This situation report is current as of 6:30 pm. It concludes Embassy Nairobi's Referendum situation reports.
2. Results from approximately 200 of 210 constituencies have been counted and final results should be announced
within the next hour. The ""Yes"" vote is about 5.5 million and the ""No"" vote is about 2.5 million. Final results should
show ""Yes"" with about 69 percent.
3. President Kibaki, Prime Minister Odinga, and Vice President Musyoka addressed a large crowd at the Kenya
International Conference Center at about 6:00 pm. Avoiding triumphalism , they struck themes of unity, reconciliation,
renewal, and building a new Kenya. After Odinga called for unity and paid tribute to Kibaki's leadership, Kibaki noted
that Kenya was coming to the end of an historic 20-year journey. The adoption of a new constitution was a victory for
those who had fought long and hard for a new constitutional dispensation that would usher in a new Kenyan nation. He
congratulated Kenyans on a successful and peaceful resolution of the constitutional process that showed that Kenya's
democratic institutions had come of age. Kibaki said he was particularly pleased with the transparent and efficient
conduct of the Interim Independent Electoral Commission. He called on all elements of Kenyan society to implement
the constitution. Referring to opposition to the constitution, Kibaki said their voices would be heard. Democracy was
about accepting the verdict of the majority, he said, while acknowledging space for the minority.
4. Earlier in the day, opposition leader William Ruto conceded defeat. He thanked the Kenyan people for their peaceful
participation in the process and specifically thanked the more than two million people who had resisted blackmail and
manipulation to vote ""no."" He argued that the majority of Kenyans had either voted against the constitution or did not
vote. Therefore, the ""yes"" side would have to consult with the opposition on issues of concern to it.
5. Embassy observer teams have returned from the field and reported that the situation throughout Kenya, including
the Rift Valley, is calm. Tensions have eased in the Rift Valley following Ruto's concession, and Post expects the post-
Referendum period to be peaceful.

I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood,
rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water
— perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not
given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous
amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to
CDM and Jake).

a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the

To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.
Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure it more clearly answers your question.

Jake, Joe,
Here is the update from 10 and PRM for the Secretary (as you recall she had met with the outgoing head of UNFPA):
Eric and I would like to update you on the Secretary-General's selection process of the next head of UNFPA.
Working closely with PRM and USUN, we gathered 22 names as possible candidates from various sources, including
NG0s, governments, and respected individuals in the health sector. We whittled down this list to three people who
have qualifications that we believe are necessary for the job: a deep understanding of and support for UNFPA's
reproductive health/family planning mission and its critical role in implementing the ICPD Program of Action, strong

leadership and advocacy skills, and strong management ability to oversee an organization with over 2000 employees
worldwide.
We see the leading candidates as:
USUN concurs and is in touch with the SG's office to convey our views. The SG will make his own shortlist based on a UN
review panel's recommendations. He is expected to announce his selection in October to allow the designee some
overlap with the incumbent, Thoraya Obaid, whose term expires at the end of the year. We will keep you apprised as
the process continues.

SUKKUR (AP) - Downpours are again swelling rivers and streams in Pakistan, where some 1,500 people have died in
flooding over the past two weeks.
Thousands are being evacuated as forecasters say more heavy rain could be on the way.
Pakistani officials estimate as many as 13 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in the country's 63-
year history.
Pakistan's prime minister says Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called him to offer every possible assistance,
and NATO says it will help coordinate aid from partner nations.

do so carefully and as David points out with a great deal of sensitivity for the families.
For example when I was in Jeddah I met with a group of prominent Islamic scholars
several of whom were leading Saudi doctors. We talked about ways they could reach out to their colleagues in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. We should get them this information and see if we can enlist them in this effort. Walter will know how
to reach them. David will advise on best way to coordinate with families.

American VIP humiliated at airport
Prof. Donna Shalala, Clinton's secretarrof health, arrives in Israel in order to fight academic
boycott against Israel, claims she was held at Ben-Gurion Airport just because she has Arab
last name
Itamar Eichner
This is not how she imagined her visit to Israel. Prof. Donna Shalala, who served as the US Secretary
of Health and Human Services for eight years under Clinton and is currently the president of the
University of Miami, was held for two-and-a-half hours at Ben Gurion Airport during which she
underwent a humiliating security debriefing because of her Arab last name — all this despite the fact
that her hosts notified the airport ahead of time that she is a VIP.
The fact that Shalala arrived in Israel as part of an official delegation of the heads of universities
fighting against the academic boycott against the Jewish State also seemed not to help her.
Shalala, 69, was born in the US to Lebanese immigrant parents. She is considered a true friend of
Israel and has visited the country many times in the past.
She recently arrived in Israel as a guest of the American Jewish Congress with the objective of
increasing collaboration among universities in Israel, the US, and the Palestinian Authority. During
their visit, members of the delegation met with President Shimon Peres, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny
Ayalon, and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770414 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770414 Date: 08/31/2015
The official visit ended on July 12, but Shalala stayed on for another two days for a private visit.
The AJC claims that it notified the Israel Airports Authority of Shalala's VIP status as is customary
prior to her departure. However, the IAA claims that it has no record on file for Shalala prior to her
arrival.
When Shalala arrived at the airport, she was not recognized as a VIP and was even afforded what
she claims to be ""special"" treatment because of her Arab last name. She claims she was held for two-
and-a-half hours during which she was asked invasive and humiliating personal questions. Despite
the delay, she managed to board the flight to the US. Officials who spoke with her said she was
deeply offended by the treatment she received.
An IAA spokesperson reported in response: ""This incident is unknown to us. We performed a
thorough check. There was no contact made with us or any other body. No unusual events were
registered at Ben Gurion Airport, and we have no idea about this incident, which, from our
perspective, never happened.""
IAA officials said that root of the problem is that the host organizations don't bother accompanying
their guests to the airport.
The incident was raised Wednesday during a discussion convened by Deputy Foreign Ministry
Ayalon to discuss treatment of VIPs at Ben Gurion Airport. During the discussion, it was agreed that a
new protocol will be drafted that will keep incidents to a minimum.
Shalala preferred not to comment on the article.

Dear Cheryl:
Jean-Louis and I had a lengthy conversation today covering a broad range of subjects relating to your interest in
supporting textile and apparel activity in Haiti. He has subsequently shared with me a number of specific materials on
the Haiti project, including an email of yours which highlights the objectives of the project and a suggested timeline, as
well as the business proposal made by Hansoll. When I digest these latter materials, I will consider myself in a much
better position to make responsive recommendations to you.
As I communicated to Jean-Louis, I am happy to be helpful to you and the State Department on this project. I can make
myself available a couple of days a month for meetings and pretty much on an as needed basis for phone conversations.
I retain my affiliation with Warburg Pincus, the global private equity firm. This requires my presence in New York
(generally) a couple of days a week. As I think you know, I am also Chairman of the Board of Campbell Soup Company.
This entails three or four days a month.
Fortunately, I am not really ""retired."" This means that I have some flexibility in how I spend my time. You should feel
free to call on me.
I retain my interest in and connections with the retail and apparel industry. While I am far from an expert on sourcing
and production of apparel and textiles, I have some relevant experience and many friends who will do their best to keep
me from looking foolish.
I will be in Baltimore and Washington for the next few days. Either you or Jean-Louis should feel comfortable in calling
on my cell phone In the interim, I will review these materials and speak again with Jean-Louis.
Regards,
Paul

some new language contained herein, I wanted to shoot this around one last time before we send it to S. If anyone has
any serious reaction to anything contained herein, please flag by 3:00 pm today. The speechwriters are also going to

S., D/S, P, T, VCI, EUR, and SIP colleagues,
Attached is a draft of S. 's testimony for next Tuesday's SFRC hearing on the New START Treaty. Please let us
know if you have any proposed edits and suggestions as soon as possible, and no later than 2:00 pm tomorrow
(Friday). As you review this draft, a few reminders:
• The testimony should be around 5-8 minutes, and ideally on the lower end of that spectrum, so
suggestions that are word-count-neutral (or suggestions stripping or streamlining verbiage) are much
preferred.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770461 Date: 08/31/2015
• Unlike previous remarks, this is a public hearing and the testimony will be publicly available. I tried to
strip out language from previous remarks accordingly, and I have one question embedded therein on one
particular clause.
• While these remarks are drafted to be slightly more formal (as compared to the All Senators Brief), they
still should be as accessible as possible, esp. given the lack of extensive substantive expertise by many
of our SFRC Senators.
• Please return edits on a bureau-wide basis.
H, T, and VCI are also coordinating on a full briefing binder that we plan to deliver to S. by COB
tomorrow. We can certainly shoot that around to anyone who would like a pdf copy.
Thanks,
Dave

Subject: Karzai meeting
Dear Melanne and Saba,
I've attached the notes from our meeting with Karzai; they may be helpful in preparing for next week
On the positive side, he committed to including women in any formal negotiations with the Taliban. Hopefully we can nail that down
firmly -- it would be both a good safeguard and a signal to the Taliban of the kind of Afghanistan they will be joining if they do indeed
ever want to join it
Beyond that, he was in ""women's lives first, women's rights second"" mode — speaking passionately about the human cost of the
conflict and the impossibility of Afghanistan enjoying genuine human rights until the fighting ends. He did this to the point of
denying that any real human rights progress had come in his presidency (thus implying that bringing in Taliban would not make
matters worse).
In terms of your messaging, it would be great if, when the Secretary stresses that reconciling insurgents should accept the Afghan
constitution and laws, she specifically mentions the right of girls to go to school and work and take part in the political process. That
would be consistent, I think, with what the administration has said before, but more explicit. Karzai told us that his government
already stresses those specific rights (that's not true --but it suggests that it would be hard for them to disagree if the US and
international community made it part of their mantra).
It would also, of course, be great if she could find a way to express concern about giving reconciling Taliban leaders who have a track
record of brutality, including attacks on girls schools and killings of women who defy their threats, positions in local or national
government. One can support negotiations even with the worst of the worst of the Taliban, and offer them other kinds of
incentives. But we should draw the line at offering positions of authority over the lives of the people they have been terrorizing (as
the Pakistanis did, disastrously, in Swat).
Hope this helps,
Tom

First major ministerial in Afghanistan since the 1970s. The very fact of it is a big deal.

Karzai's inauguration, announcement of the President's strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabul
conference.
Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, service
delivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious;
and they reflect months of work and consultation.
Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill,
de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. This
is NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan government
leadership and ownership
Follow-through and accountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghan
government committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, we'll be heavily focused
on implementation. This is about mutual accountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth.
July 2011: The president's strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts to
take the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civilian
commitment to support Afghanistan long into the future.
Clear strategy: Reverse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghans
develop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsible
transition to Afghan leadership.
Clear desired end-state: An Afghan state that is willing and strong enough to ensure that global terrorists never again
have safe haven within its borders; can withstand internal and external threats; and can continue to make long-term
political and economic progress, all with sustainable levels of international support.
Civ-mil cooperation: Unfortunate to lose General McChrystal, but maintained continuity with General Petraeus and we
have only intensified our civ-mil engagement both in Kabul and Washington.

HANOI - Secretary Clinton expressed concern over Vietnam's arrests of dissidents, attacks on religious groups and curbs
on Internet freedom, but said the countries remained friends. The United States and Communist-run Vietnam marked
15 years of diplomatic ties this month and Clinton said the two countries had ""learned to see each other not as former
enemies but as actual and potential partners, colleagues and friends. We have consistently moved in the direction of
engagement and cooperation, even on those issues where we disagree."" Clinton spoke during a two-day visit to Hanoi
for the Asia-Pacific region's biggest security dialogue.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Conflict Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in ""conflict minerals"" that has
funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless
more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.
President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what
they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its
support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one
of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.
After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of
our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC. We continue to work with the government to crack
down on corruption, both bilaterally and through the Great Lakes Contact Group. At the United Nations
Security Council, we successfully pushed to expand the listing criteria in the DRC Sanctions Committee to
include those supporting illegal armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources. We have provided
support for initiatives on certification and due diligence that have been initiated by the government of the DRC,
local and foreign industry groups, and regional and international institutions. And we have met with a wide
range of industry representatives and discussed the responsibility of end-users to ensure their supply chains are
free of conflict minerals.
All of these steps underscore the commitment of the United States to stand with the people of Congo and to
work toward an end to this conflict.

All
The Post wrote a good editorial today on our Internet freedom work (see below). It's a far cry from what the editorial
board had to say in November (here) and is the product of a lot of hard work from several bureaus and offices in the
Department to drive Internet freedom as a policy priority. EEB and DRL will convene a meeting of the NetFreedom
Taskforce next week at the working level to continue to advance Internet freedom within the building and with external
audiences. It is nice to see some success in changing the narrative on this important but challenging issue.

State Department is taking right steps to foster Internet freedom
http://www.washingtonpost.comAvp-dyn/content/anicle/2010/07/20/AR2010072005363_pf.html

BILLIONS OF people live in countries where the Internet is not free. Confined behind the elaborate firewalls of
authoritarian regimes such as China and Iran, they find their rights to expression threatened online and off-- by
elaborate systems of monitoring and censorship and by harsh laws that punish bloggers with imprisonment or
even death.
In January, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke powerfully in support of Internet freedom, saying,
""We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. And we
recognize that the world's information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it.""
Since then, the State Department has brought the issue of online freedom to the table in its diplomacy around
the world and joined with Internet providers and social media companies to foster public-private partnership in
Internet freedom. Such collaboration is key, since authoritarian regimes so often contract out the daily work of
censorship to private companies.

Congress, too, has showed commitment to openness online, allocating $35 million in funding between the 2009
and 2010 budgets for work that promotes Internet freedom. This money has yet to be spent, but the State
Department finally has sent the names of designated recipients of the 2009 budget's $5 million in Internet
freedom funding to Congress for its approval and soon will begin the process for distributing this year's grants.
As it moves forward on this vital issue, the State Department must carefully determine how best to spend its
limited resources. Yes, there is no silver bullet to guarantee freedom on the Internet. But it is possible to do
great good with available funds. Investing in censorship-circumvention techniques like those that powered
Tehran's ""Twitter revolution"" in June 2009 could have a tremendous, measurable impact.
Although this solution is not without its problems -- the best-known provider of this software is the Falun Gong-
affiliated Global Internet Freedom consortium, and users behind China's Great Firewall may mistrust the
technology of a group their government has banned -- the State Department must seriously consider channeling
funds to organizations that have demonstrated great potential to make a difference.
The State Department is attempting a more holistic approach to Internet freedom, spreading funds across a
variety of projects. Monitoring the efficacy of chosen solutions and rewarding those that produce results will be
essential as this program continues.
A cyberspace without walls or barriers, where people can assemble and express themselves freely, without fear
of censorship or imprisonment, will make the world safer for the United States and for democracies everywhere.
Continued public-private partnership, prioritization of Internet freedom in diplomacy and the wise deployment
of allocated funds will move this ideal closer to reality.

The below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.
The Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)
In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been
such a revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium
be used? What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?
Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs
disseminate odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites
are attacked and Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are
infiltrating social networks to spread propaganda and false information.
It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naive belief that a new technology,
however efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.
Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most
fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed
peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the
Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can
be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of
repression or a violation of human rights.
In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion
and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.
However, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the
Internet, that monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The
Internet can be used against citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential
dissidents. Some regimes are already acquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.
If all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used
the Internet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not

talking about absolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm
talking about real freedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.
In the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental
organisations, such as Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have
made a strong commitment to these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the
West against the rest of the world. No fewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the
Information Society acknowledged that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet,
especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression and freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty
countries fail to live up to their commitments.
For the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists,
business people and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we
want to take is the right one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the
commitments that governments have made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think
we should provide assistance to cyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political
repression, and of the need to show our solidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs
working on these issues. I think that we should also discuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding
the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and tracking web users.
These issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital
amnesty for everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a
framework that brings together government, civil society and international experts.
Another project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to
give the Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so
that it will be more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental
freedoms.
This is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal
and open Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for
privacy and, on the other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are
closed off from each other to serve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.
Freedom of expression is""the foundation of all other freedoms"". Without it, there are no'free nations"",
Voltaire said. This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The
defence of fundamental freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet. It is
everyone's business.

I heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.
Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.
Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I
think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He
was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.
He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original
discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed. Alfred Perez later
served on the Pew Commission on Foster care and is now teaching at the University of
Chicago. http://www.ssa.uchicaoo.edu/facultv/ptlect/Derez-a.shtml

Pulse - automatically updates when you open it. If you look to the left of each name of the news org, you'll initially see a
circle like symbol. That means it's updating.
Oh, actually the problem you are having is that it needs to find WiFi - do you have WiFi in whatever home you're in now?
We just need to set that up once and it will subsequently connect whenever it senses that wifi.
And yes on Monday can spend some quality time.

Judith,
Below is a rough outline of your trip to Doha, as it currently stands.
LOGISTICS:
You are currently scheduled to arrive in Doha on May 1 at 6:30 and depart May 2 at 7 pm. Traveling with you will be
Kitty DiMartino, Joe Mellott, Mark Davidson, and GSEC's LTC Eric Schoennauer. Dana Smith will fly in from the Media
Hub in Dubai to meet you in Doha.
Key events:
Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: AJ Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with senior Al staff,
including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the Al side and 6 on ours. (The dinner is
schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations for the party to stay in the same
hotel.)
Meeting with AJ Board Members at AJ Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the Qatari leadership
of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some Al Board representatives. We
expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.
(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (HBJ): As PM, HBJ is the ultimate Qatari authority
on Al. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as necessary. We expect to know in a few
days if HBJ will be available.
Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of Doha. They will brief
you on their .within their AOR, but with particular focus on activities in B1
1.4(D)
MEDIA:
Feature on AJ Arabic: 15 minute ""feature"" piece filmed at AJ Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the Entrepreneurship

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770698 Date: 08/31/2015
Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's ""top"" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute ""feature"" piece similar to the one for Al Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.
Note — Wadah Khanfar has been closely engaged on, if not driving, the portions of your program that deal with Al. Post
reports that he is very pleased to have this opportunity for you to engage with Al leadership in Doha.
Best,
Ann

Subject: (Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. ""We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel,"" Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. ""We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not.""
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them ""immediately."" ""We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process,"" Netanyahu said. ""They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks.""
Netanyahu's remarks come just days ahead of a meeting in Cairo between Abbas and the Arab League at which the
Palestinian leader will discuss the indirect talks with Israel, which began in May, and will also address the pressing
question of a shift to direct negotiations.
Abbas has repeatedly said he would not move to direct talks without tangible progress on the key issues of borders and
security, and without a complete freeze on Jewish settlement building on occupied Palestinian land.
Abbas is due to meet Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos July 27 in Amman before flying to Cairo.

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director,
Kristy Trautmann.
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in
August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but
influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in
our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with
far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and
by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds
from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit
organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,
an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people
with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and
ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the
impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused
foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million
has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with
disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national
models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.
Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical
staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money
for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first
such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare
for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at
Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for
Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more
accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the
issues we have,"" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based
in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped
solve are ones that people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders
together to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,
leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA
and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.
""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the
community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,
and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order
""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned
something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's
ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A
new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We
have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program
director for six years, was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the
foundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know
that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the
populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.""</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770759 Date: 08/31/2015

When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in
August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but
influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in
our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with
far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and
by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds
from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit
organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae,
an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people
with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and
ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the
impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but it's a very focused
foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million
has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with
disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national
models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings.
Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical
staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money
for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first
such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare
for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at
Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for
Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more
accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the
issues we have,"" said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based
in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004.

Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped
solve are ones that people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders
together to get to the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders,
leading by example on the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA
and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee.
""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the
community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner,
and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order
""were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned
something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's
ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A
new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We
have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundation's program
director for six years, was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the
foundation into the next decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. ""We know
that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the
populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.""

Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs
administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy.""
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.
Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>RELEASE IN PART

In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister
told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians.
Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state,
the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)
""He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I
heard from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not
one of them.""
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is
Jewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place
here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in
Entebbe Rescue
by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on 4nd
On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day
for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday
night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved
into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One of his less
known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of Memorial
Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State of
Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when
seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.

the timing to the Palestinians themselves. Sheik Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani, who chaired the meeting of Arab foreign
ministers in Cairo said July 29 the timing of the direct talks ""is a matter for the Palestinian side to decide."" The U.S. and
the Europeans have been pushing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to restart the direct talks, which broke off in
2008, immediately. Abbas, however, has said he would only restart talks if Israel agrees to a halt in settlement
construction and accepts a Palestinian state in territories seized in the 1967 Middle East war, the West Bank, Gaza, and
east Jerusalem. He first wants progress in the current U.S. mediated indirect talks.

The Unnecessary Fall
A counter-history of the Obama presidency.
• John B. Judis
• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am
On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were
amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the
""five pillars"" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that
would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society.
Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. ""We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a
foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,"" he declared. Obama
would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private
White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with
the New Foundation as a slogan. ""I don't think it's going to work,"" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it
sounded ""like a woman's girdle.""
One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a
Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, ""Tonight, I want to
examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
prosperous world."" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked
members of Congress to join him ""in building that new foundation."" Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a
few underwear jokes and was then forgotten.
Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over
his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his
entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired
campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and
initially stirred hopes of a ""transformational"" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with
large parts of the electorate.
To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men
contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his
party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful
business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.
Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an
inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.
In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from
yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in
Bill Clinton's words, ""those who work hard and play by the rules."" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric
that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below
(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street
lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.
Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns
have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,
you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's
what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the
Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.
Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the
$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of
2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and
Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts.
In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform
while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What
doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an
atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.
As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent
that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a
very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the ""money
changers,"" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise""
speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. ""Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new
age,"" he declared.
Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling
the bonuses they gave themselves ""shameful"" and an ""outrage""—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the
bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman
Robert Gibbs said, ""emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street."" And, in his
Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, ""was caused by
a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main
Street.""
Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank
and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing
bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he
would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in
sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or
even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama
and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)
Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy
Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go
under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors
with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic
Senator Byron Dorgan told me, ""Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the
administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.""
By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly
formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less
extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public
disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's
handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic
policies to his handling of the financial crisis.
Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began
with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses
to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no
legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris
Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) ""The pitchforks were out. It added injury to
injury,"" Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a
favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.
The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health
care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was ""where's my bailout?"" (Obama himself
acknowledged that it was ""one of the most frequent questions"" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a
bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout
for the uninsured—or ""reparations,"" as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, ""hardworking
citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps"" by ""moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling
over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts."" Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed
as aiding ""the moochers,"" but not the ""hardworking citizens."" In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster.
Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts were
being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White
House began calling themselves the ""pitchfork gang,"" but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough
on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry
Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. ""There was a continual tension in the White House,""
says a person who was privy to the discussions. ""One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it
back.""
By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent
of Americans thought Obama ""had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions""
than to the ""problems faced by middle class Americans."" Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid
more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced
a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses ""obscene"" and said, ""we want our money back."" In a
January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the
word ""fighting"" 13 times and ""fight"" nine times. ""I will not stop fighting for you,"" he declared.
But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io,
he said that he didn't ""begrudge"" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO
Lloyd Blankfein. ""I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.""
Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,
but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an
emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their ""failure of responsibility."" As a result of the
indictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate
Republicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger
bill than the Democrats had ever expected.
But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon's
Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president
dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has
said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.
Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to
the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama's
image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a ""strong leader."" Voters will
sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as ""strong,""
but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.
What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,
and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a
November rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White
House's weak political performance.
In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of
Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration
finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate
saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.
In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for
infrastructure spending.
Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was
necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce
unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional
Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have
underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout
to get more from Congress.
But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);
framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,
and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made
this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.
So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't
itself a result of political timidity.
The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he
thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to
the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then
to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when
the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he
didn't really try.
Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with
steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his
political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for
voters to ""stay the course"" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. ""We are clearing away
the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,"" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing ""the blame
game,"" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were
predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.
Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he
did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with
Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed
confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a
postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic
program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command
those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a
narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.
Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is
clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was
schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings
of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial
tactics behind.
The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different
style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring
videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago
Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a
higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-
racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,
who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)
Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.
He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to ""end the political strategy that has been based on division,"" to
""turn the page"" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides
jokingly referred to him as the ""black Jesus."" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively
foment it. ""In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,"" he declared in February 2009. During his campaign
and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his
legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.
His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of
""hope"" and ""change"" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a
meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded
equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the ""cynical politics in Washington."" Within the White
House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama ""brand."" Organizing for America, the administration's campaign
organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties
across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.
These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an
iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians
have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained ""the other"" that he
aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.
The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts
in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall
Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,
Alter writes, ""Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted
while they remained in peril."" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making
it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery
and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.
Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle
class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist
Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and
probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American
political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,
presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.
If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president
in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and
Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds
and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or
hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection
Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come
in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.

The Unnecessary Fall
A counter-history of the Obama presidency.
• John B. Judis
• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am
On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were
amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the
""five pillars"" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that
would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society.
Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. ""We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a
foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,"" he declared. Obama
would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private
White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with
the New Foundation as a slogan. ""I don't think it's going to work,"" Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it
sounded ""like a woman's girdle.""
One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a
Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, ""Tonight, I want to
examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
prosperous world."" Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked
members of Congress to join him ""in building that new foundation."" Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a
few underwear jokes and was then forgotten.
Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over
his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his
entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired
campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
initially stirred hopes of a ""transformational"" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with
large parts of the electorate.
To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men
contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his
party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful
business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.
Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an
inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.
In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from
yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in
Bill Clinton's words, ""those who work hard and play by the rules."" They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric
that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below
(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street
lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.
Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns
have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,
you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's
what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the
Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.
Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the
$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of
2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and
Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts.
In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform
while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What
doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an
atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.
As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent
that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a
very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the ""money
changers,"" as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous ""malaise""
speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. ""Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new
age,"" he declared.
Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling
the bonuses they gave themselves ""shameful"" and an ""outrage""—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman
Robert Gibbs said, ""emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street."" And, in his
Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, ""was caused by
a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main
Street.""
Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank
and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing
bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he
would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in
sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or
even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama
and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)
Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy
Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go
under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors
with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic

and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made
this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.
So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't
itself a result of political timidity.
The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he
thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to
the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then
to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when
the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he
didn't really try.
Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with
steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his
political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for
voters to ""stay the course"" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. ""We are clearing away
the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,"" Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing ""the blame
game,"" but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were
predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.
Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he
did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with
Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed
confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic
program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command
those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a
narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.
Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is
clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was
schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings
of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial
tactics behind.
The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different
style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring
videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago
Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a
higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-
racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,
who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)
Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.
He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to ""end the political strategy that has been based on division,"" to
""turn the page"" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides
jokingly referred to him as the ""black Jesus."" While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively
foment it. ""In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,"" he declared in February 2009. During his campaign
and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his
legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.
His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of
""hope"" and ""change"" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a
meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded
equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the ""cynical politics in Washington."" Within the White
House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama ""brand."" Organizing for America, the administration's campaign
organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties
across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.
These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an
iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians
have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained ""the other"" that he
aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.
The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts
in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall
Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,
Alter writes, ""Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
while they remained in peril."" Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making
it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery
and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.
Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle
class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist
Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and
probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American
political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,
presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.
If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president
in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and
Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds
and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or
hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection
Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come
in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.

The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
have preconditions - dictated by Israel.
By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14
cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held ""without
preconditions,"" and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to
enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40
points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he
had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie ""Friendship Games,"" to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along
with Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,
an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to
the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join
the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian
team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the
conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East
Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where
talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the
Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging
Abbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding
building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on
the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.
It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then
he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the
tournament, is not measured by the terms ""victory"" or ""defeat."" What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it
was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process
with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?
What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's
approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with
another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist
Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple
Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more ""victories"" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, ""without preconditions,"" and
we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state
(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided
the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian
president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayer

AUGUST 30, 2010
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and
have quietly given more than a hundred million dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a
tall, jovial-looking billionaire took the stage. It was the seventieth annual
spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated
for his generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated
$2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season, and had given many millions
before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's
co-chairs, Blaine Trump, in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had
been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth

Avenue apartment that Koch had bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years
later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has
become one of the city's most prominent philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a
hundred million dollars to modernize Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre
building, which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American
Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is named for him. This spring,
after noticing- the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, Koch pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation.
He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in the
city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where,
after he donated more than forty million dollars, an endowed chair and a
research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary
co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said that a scheduling conflict had
prevented her from attending. Yet had the 'First Lady shared the stage with Koch
it might have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as
part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth attacks on the federal
government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of
Koch Industries, a conglomerate, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, whose annual

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has grown
spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took
charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and
control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper
towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-ea ific lumber, Stainmaster carpet, and Lycra, among
other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest private company in the
country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and
Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest men
in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is exceeded
only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal
' and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less
oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail
with the brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute
named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And
Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate
science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related
to climate change, underwriting a huge network of foundations, think tanks, and
political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns

against so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the
economic-stimulus program—that, in political circles, their ideological network
is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the
environmental record of our companies."" And David Koch, in a recent, admiring
article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his
family into ""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American
politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a
. nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Koons are on a whole different level.
There's no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is
what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've
never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our :times.""
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for
Prosperity Foundation—an organization that David Koch started, in 2004—held a
different kind of gathering. Over the July
. 4th weekend, a summit called Texas
Defending the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin.
Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures, he did not attend the
summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was
roused not by a dance performance but by a series of speakers denouncing
President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit, warned that

Administration officials ""have a socialist vision for this country.""
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training
session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An advertisement cast the event as a
populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today, the voices of .average
Americans are being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said.
""But you can do something about it:"" The pitch made no mention of its corporate
funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have
largely eluded public notice. David Axelrod, Obama'-s senior adviser, said, ""What
they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought
to you by a bunch of oil billionaires.""
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson, denied that the Kochs
had direct links to the Tea. Party, saying that Americans for Prosperity is ""an
independent organization and Koch. companies do not in any way direct their
activities."" Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by
Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically
to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York; ""I've never been to a
tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me.""
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable-a longtime political operative who
draws a salary from Americans for Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded
political groups since 1994-spoke less warily. ""We love what the Tea Parties are
doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
the crowd cheered. In a subsequent interview, sh described herself as an early
member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was
cool!"" She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help
""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give them ""next-step
training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be
channelled ""more effectively."" And she noted that Americans for Prosperity had
provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said
of the Kochs, ""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board.
I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative of what they do.""
Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas
branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its Blogger of the Year Award to a young
woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama
as the ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the
President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonic possession (aka schizophrenia,
etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the
actress best known for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure.""
She declared, ""They don't want our children to know about their rights. They
don't want our children to know about a God!""
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general
of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama was ""the most radical President ever to
occupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
government taking over our economy and our lives."" Countering °barna, Cruz
proclaimed, was ""the epic fight. of our generation!"" As the crowd rose to its
feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory,
or death!""
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the
movement's inception. In the weeks before the first Tax Day protests, in April,
2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party
Talking Points."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the
Missouri branch urged members to sign up for ""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration""
and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the
rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web
site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in North Carolina.""
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elect-ions represents a political
triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to ""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea
Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass
movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once
worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank
that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is
that it's been all chiefs and no Indians. There haven't been any actual people,
.like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out
there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are
""trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own
policies.""
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and
David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""The Koch brothers gave the money that founded
it. It's like they put the seeds in the around. Then the rainstorm comes, and
the frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews.
Instead, a prominent New York public-relations executive who is close with the
Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York,
and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a
Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch, called him ""a
patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle
decency"" and the ""range of his public interests.""
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities,
""To call them under the radar is an understatement. They are underground!""
Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart: This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty.
themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic political strategist who has studied the
conaervative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
the anti-Obama movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the
same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill Clinton. They are out to
destroy progressivism.""
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to
Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer who settled in Texas and
ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended PLI.T., where he earned a degree in
chemical engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for
converting oil into gasoline, but, according to family lore, America's major oil
companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to
succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties,
his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime set up
fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged
several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience,
and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of
his company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed
at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had•been destroyed in the Second
World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the
Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at
having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the John Birch Society,
the arch-conservative group known, in part, for a highly skeptical view of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published
broadside, Koch claimed that ""the Communists have infiltrated both the Democrat '
and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression
of Communists in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement.
""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America,"" he
warned. Welfare was.a secret blot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they
would foment ""a vicious race war."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea
Party's talk of a secret socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is
a Communist, unknown to the rest of us:""
Koch tarried Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had
four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins, David and William. John Damgard, the
president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and
friend. He recalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized
rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in Africa, and requiring them
1-o do -Farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a
large compound across from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could
hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed to join
them. ""By instilling a work ethic in me at an early age, my father did me a b
favor, although it didn't seem like a favor back then,"" Charles has written. ""By
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David
Koch recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was
constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government,"" he
told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author
of ""Radicals for Capitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's
something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was
bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes
was not good.""
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to
military school. Charles, David, and William all earned engineering degrees at
their father's alma meter, M.I.T.,, and later joined the family company. Charles
eventually assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the
company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and studied playwriting at
the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished
him financially. (Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this.)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business
Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred Koch's will made his sons
extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003
speech to alumni at Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million •
dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said, ""You might
ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let

me tell you a story. It all, started when I was a little boy. One day, my father
gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold
them for ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this
went on day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,
until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they
did not share all his views, according to diZerega, who befriended Charles in
the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society
bookstore in Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to
participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It was pretty clear that
Charles thought some of the Birch .Scciety was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandoned right-wing
views, and became a political-science professor. He credits Charles with opening
his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles
is one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega
believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward intellectual trajectory,
transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the
U.S. government, and seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a
tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega writes,
""As state socialism failed . . . the target for many within these organizations
shifted to any kind of regulation at all. 'Socialism' kept being defined

downwards.""
Members• of the John Birch Society developed an interest in a school of Austrian
economists who promoted free-market ideals. Charles and David Koch were
particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of ""The
Road to Serfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led,
inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek's belief in unfettered capitaiisth has
proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents;
lately, Tea Party supporters have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio
host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""The Road
to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on
Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the Kochs; in the midst of a recent on-air
parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch
for this information."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert
LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state but didn't like the label
""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that
""government is a disease masquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an
institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, of
Reason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,""
and that the school was ""a tiny world of people who thought the New Deal was a
horrible mistake."" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries.
In 1980, William, with assistance from Freddie, attempted to take over the
company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In
retaliation, the company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William.
(""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, the economist, told
me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and
David on the other.. In 1983, Charles and David bought out their brothers' share
in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained, and
litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival
private investigators; in 1990, they walked past one another with stony
expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually, Freddie moved to Monaco,
which has no income tax. He bought historic estates in France, Austria, and
elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to
yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five million dollars to win the America's
Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded
.
rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the investment-banking firm Evercore, told me
that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remained in
Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
community charities. David moved to New York City, where he is an executive
vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the
company. Charles runs ."" David, described by associates as ""affable"" and ""a
bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a
yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where
he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an ""East
Coast version of Hugh Hefner's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a
fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park
Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan,
and more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both
brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters
of hard-line libertarian politics in America. Charles's goal, as Doherty
described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first
major public step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine,
to run for public office. They had become supporters of the Libertarian Party,
and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against
Ronald Reagan from the right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign
donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
•
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has
only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David
Koch, who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party
movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that libertarians were getting ready to stage
""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The
Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the
° .C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social
Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income
taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs, and
suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of
individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a more traditional conservative,
called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""
That November,. the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote.
The brothers realized that their brand of politics didn't sell at the ballot
box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. •""It tends to
be a nasty, corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm
interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's book, the
Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a
script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the
direction of America, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas
percolate from: academia and think tanks.""
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena.
But they poured more than a hundred million dollars into dozens of seemingly
independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch
family foundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations,
three of which they founded, and several of which they direct. The Kochs and
their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy
groups, and lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled
suspicion on the 'left; Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress, has called
the Kochs ""the billionaires behind the hate.""
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have Spent on politics. Public tax
records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable
Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe
Charitable Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his slife, along
with two company employees and an accountant, spent more than twenty-eight
million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and
twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty
million dollars. on lobbying. Separately, the company's political-action
committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
campaigns, more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch
Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions, as it
has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other
family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political
contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David Koch was the biggest
individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a
million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Koons may be untraceable; federal
tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit
groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of
their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties, the Olin
family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for
funding right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And
during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of Andrew Mellon, spent
millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt,
vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the
Kochs' effort is unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds:
""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier
George Soros, runs a foundation, the Open Society Institute, that has spent as
much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including
Obamas. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that Soros's giving is
transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own
economic interests."" The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit
groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for
industry. Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful
idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for
corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making
money with freedom.""
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose
of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively
nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the
National Committee for *Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the
*Kochs' foundations as being self-serving, concluding, ""These foundations give
money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that
impact the profit margin of Koch Industries.""
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding
'organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian direction. Among the
institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice,. which
files lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane
Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Institute, which promotesa conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the
organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position papers
that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going
to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes
along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and
start doing things we don't agree with, we withdraw funding.""
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the
.vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell, then a Virginia
attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The
antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow
Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against
corporations. Powell, writing- a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged
American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he
warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, respectable elements of
soCiety""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote,
business leaders needed to wage a long-term, unified campaign to change public
opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the
deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about social change,"" he told Doherty,
requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
""from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots
organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project, he
admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian
think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity,
between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the
institute. Today, Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its
experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream
media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been
critical of both parties. Put it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts,
reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming
as ""beyond dispute,"" the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the Times to
contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political
attempts to stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed
Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me that ""global-warming
theories give the government more control of the economy.""
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate
scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate scientists at the University of

to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that

global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public, one Cato
scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal.
But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers, and
nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus
on global warming.
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate
change. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently
issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal,
more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have
exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic
on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has
played in fostering such doubt.
In a 2002 memo; the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that.so
long as ""voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the
scientific community"" the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of
environmental reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations
strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall
regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental Skepticism, such
as the Heritage Foundation, which has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in
the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the presentation of global warming as a
scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by
Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a
vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of
California, San Diego, is the co-author of ""Merchants of Doubt,"" a new book that
chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Mocha, as the heads of ""a company with refineries
and pipelines,"" have ""a lot at. stake."" She added, ""If the answer is to phase out
fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we
shouldn't be surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been
caused by human activity. Even if it has been, h said, the heating of the
planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern
Hemisphere. ""The Earth will be able to support enormously more peoplebecause
far greater land area will be available to produce food,"" he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason
University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another think tank. Now known as
the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which
has gone to the Mercatus Center, a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for
deregulation.policy in Washington,"" Rob Stein, the Demodratic strategist, said.
It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university, and receives
public funds,"" Stein noted. ""Virginia is hosting an institution• that the Kochs
practically control.""
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink
heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation in Washington. In addition, he is the
president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R.
Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the
Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the
Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane, the 'head or the Cato
Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on
the board at Cato, Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested
to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's management
philosophy, which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success,"" and
trademarked under the name Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book,
Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

containing ""five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, knowledge.processes,
decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that
Charles ""thinks he's a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing
clothes."" Fink, by contrast, has been .far more embracing of Charles's ideas.
(Fink, like the Kochs, declined to be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropists, Fink adopted the language of economics
when speaking about the Mercatus Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers
should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy ""products.""
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the mos.t important think
tank you've never heard of,"" and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three
regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been
suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have
""other means of fighting [their] battles,"" and that the Mercatus Center does not
actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law
professor at the University of Texas, who specializes in environmental issues,.
told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and Mercatus
has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed
with the Mercatus Center called it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The
lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank,"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic

degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly
with the economic interests of their funders.""
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of
pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley, an
economist. who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the
proposed
. rule. The E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free
skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if pollution
were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin
cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley's smog argument.
Evaluating the E.P.A.rule, the court found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly
disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the
opinion, the court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in
calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability
Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously
attended legal junkets, on a Montana ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation
for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their
attendance.
deas don't happen on their own,"" Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a
Tea Party advocacy group, told me. ""Throughout history, ideas need patrons."" The

Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver
those ideas to the street, and•to attract the public's support. In 1984, David
Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization, and Kibbe joined them.
The group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but
according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the
Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission, Kibbe said,
""was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We
read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions—Saul Alinsky,
Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an
example of nonviolent, social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to
sell ideas, not candidates."" Within a few years, the group had mobilized fifty
paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs'
agenda. David and Charles, according to one participant, were ""very controlling,
very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate
Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a
scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to
steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The
Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth
of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
investigators that oil measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""
To defend its reputation, Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss, then a premier
Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury
was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded,
without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the
committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee
staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the
Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Ballen, the counsel to the Senate committee, said,
""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!""
By 1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had
become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigna that
have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running- advertisements,
staging media events, and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies
outside the Capitol-rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into
the hearts of wavering Democrats."" ban Glickman, a former Democratic congressman
from Wichita, who supported the B.T.U. tax, recalled, ""I'd been in Congress
eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent.
They used a lot of resources and effort-their employees, too."" Glickman suffered
a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it, but I think I was probably their victim,""
he said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations
with generic-sounding names, and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent
of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created
a spinoff group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other
environmental problems ""myths."" When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated
the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of
its own.""
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report
called ""an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into -
Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,"" in
order to evade .campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had
paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races
and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an
obscure nonprofit group, the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's
minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in part by
Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of
having secretly paid for the attack ads, most of which aired in states where
Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially
active, the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races.
The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the money, refused to
comment. In 1998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
on the Kochs' payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the
Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a
threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok.""
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny
and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice Department filed two lawsuits
against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three
hundred oil spills, which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil
into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and
fourteen million dollars. In a settlement, Koch Industries paid a record
thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to spend five million dollars on
environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the
deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky
underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed
settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice
Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its
refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was liable for three hundred and
fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five
years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including the
falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David
Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time, headed the environmental-crimes
section at the Justice Department, described the suit as ""one of the most
significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added,
""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred
thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George N. Bush and other
Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel
companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary
Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies
and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit
hawks, but, according to a study by Media Matters, their companies have
benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its
weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch had attempted to get
Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support
for John Kerry, Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit
organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the
organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group, Americans
for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political
veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican
activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that
became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
Phillips's online biography describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and
""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an
even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known
for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics, called Phillips ""a grownup who can
make things happen.""
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had
only eight thousand registered members. Currently, its Web site claims that the
group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political
involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me
that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs."" And the brothers'
investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the
•
family's other organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama
Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the
1930s."" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative
operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the
editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern, thanked
David Koch, and vowed to ""unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!"" Soon
after Obama assumed office, Americans for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies
against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward
Democratic districts; eventually, the author was forced to correct the report,
but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing the paper, had labelled Obama's program ""a
slush fund,"" and Fox News and other conserVative outlets had echoed the
sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at
Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which
organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies
against health-care reform. At one rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman
was hung; at another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from
Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests outside the
Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged
that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade
legislation, which is aimed at making industries pay for the air pollution that
they create. Speakers for -the group claimed,, with exaggeration, that even
back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also
involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar, Van Jones, and waged a
crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of
ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to
Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, ""We're a grasaroots organization. . . . I think
it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
. families . . want to send
unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in
Washington, .including representatives from Americans for Prosperity, told me
that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda
The Republican leadership in Congress, he said, ""couldn't have done it without
August, when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans
who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K
Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane,"" Norquist said. ""When
Obama was 'strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak,
people are getting tough.""
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the
Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering.
Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was
working with the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were
writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups were accusing
the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech, Koch said,
""Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we
started this organization, five years ago."" He went on, ""We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of
American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the
economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. .
. . Thankfully, the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to
Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see
the same truths as we do.""
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more
recently he has come close to doing so, praising it for demonstrating the
""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in
government power, the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch,
in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees, compared the Obama
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs'
sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is
greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and since the seventies
the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than thoseof the middle class.
Yet the brothers' message has evidently resonated with-voters: a recent poll
found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an
additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections, in November.
Although the group is legally prohibited from directly .endorsing candidates, it
nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate
races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and running ads
aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is
far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring, said, ""If
you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country,
doesn't look very good at all."" He went on, ""It looks like the infrastructure
that was built and nurtured has not carried the. day."" He suggested that the
Kochs needed ""to get more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.""
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the
sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering, a routine
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment,
settled down, started a family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio,
""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone
else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord soared me for some greater
purpose.' My joke is that I've been busy ever since, doing all the good work I
can think of, so He can have confidence in me.""
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he
became a patron of cancer research, focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to
his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New
York-Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for
cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins University, and twenty-five
millior. to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his
generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership
Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board,
which guides the National Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest.
For example, at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a
champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to
prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in
great quantities, as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human
beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
whose advisory board Koch. sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients
for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of
formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped
lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that
formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on
formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch Industries has been a large funder
of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new
regulations until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought
Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion
dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and
uses it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its
annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last
December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental
affairs, sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote
that the company "",strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion that
formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not
recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of

company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of
formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Huff, an associate director at the National institute for Environmental
Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told me that it was ""disgusting"" for
Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good
for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board."" He went on,
""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to Whether N.C.I.
goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in
formaldehyde.""
Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he used to run. He said that, at
Sloan-Kettering, ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests.
The one thing we wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told
of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that he was ""surprised.""
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History, is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved
in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted with
a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years,
which notes that it is far cooler now than it.was ten thousand years ago.
Overhead, the text reads, ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that ""key human adaptations
evolved in response to environmental instability."" Only at the end of the
exhibit, under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,"" is it noted that levels of
carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are
projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for
this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil
fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying
text says, ""During the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together."" An
interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to
climate change in the future. People may build ""underground citieS,"" developing
""short, compact bodies"" or ""curved spines,"" so that ""moving around in tight
spaces will be no problem.""
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to
employees, for instance, argues that ""fluctuations in the earth's climate
predate humanity,"" and concludes, ""Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's
figure out how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs
the Web site ClimateProgressorg, is infuriated by the Smithsonian's
presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,"" he said.
""I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company,
associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are
underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to
humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that.the exhibit is not about
climate change, and described Koch as ""one of the best donors we've had, in my
tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands
off."" He noted, ""I don't know all the details of his involvement in other
issues.""
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about
them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called ""the largest
company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea
Party, and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the
brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently, President Obama took
aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser, in Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent
ruling in the Citizens United case--which struck down laws prohibiting direct
corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to
hide behind ""groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.""
. 0bama said, ""They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for Prosperity are.
You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even, he added, ""a
big oil company

2. Have received $73,358 in credit card donations from 608 donors
3. Have received $ 1,725 in ACH donations from 15 donors
4. Have received $14,025 in mailed in checks from 92 donors
5. Have received $ 3 in cash from one donor
So in total we have received $110,281 in pledges and donations from 2833 donors (assuming all my math is
right)
On average this is about $39 per donation/pledge if you excluded the ten dollar pledges/donations the
average donation was $124 dollars
As we discussed I will provide a more standardized reporting every Tuesday and Thursday - just let me know if
you want anyone else included on the reporting - jim

Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines.""
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase
in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far
shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.
Later he tells readers:
""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the
rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and
iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever
while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence
whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for
less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers
might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),
coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly
educated workers as well as less educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:
""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that
can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over
their global competitors. There is no other way.""
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile
on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible
accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?
Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The
Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and
worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""
Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,
but its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany
always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying
its goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7
.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0
percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in
spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of
demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,
greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the
economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that
increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.
The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't
have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be
controlled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it
would have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,
we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.
If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.
and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771122 Date: 08/31/2015

Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines.""
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.

MITCHELL LIKELY TO PAY THE PRICE
Ma 'arty (11/1/2010, p. 6) by Eli Bardenstein -- The US administration intends to replace its
special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, said sources in Washington. A number of
additional top officials are expected to be replaced at the same opportunity.
The reasons for Mitchell's replacement are the failure he and his team have had at renewing
the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the Administration's desire to bring new blood into
the efforts, and pressures to resume the peace process in the region.
One of the names that has already begun to circulate as a potential successor is the former US
ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk. Another possible course of action suggested by the blog
""Politico"" is to divide Mitchell's job into two: Indyk will deal with the Palestinians, while
Obama's senior aide, Dennis Ross, will deal with the Israelis.
Mitchell's spokesman, Jonathan Prince, has already left his post under unclear circumstances
and has turned to the world of private business. The State Department denied allegations that
Prince left because of criticism that he had aired about Ross maintaining positions that were
closer to the Israeli positions than to those of the White House.
Another top official in Mitchell's team, Mara Rudman, was supposed to have left her post as
the director of Mitchell's staff for a senior position in the State Department, but decided to
remain after she was not given the job.
Reports have repeatedly been received in Jerusalem about mounting tension between Mitchell
and his team, on the one hand, and Dennis Ross, who works directly for the White House, on the
other. The two parties were said to be divided over the way in which it would be possible to
persuade Netanyahu to renew the direct talks. Ross, who served in the past in Mitchell's current
capacity and headed an Israeli research center—the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute—is
believed to have been opposed to the intense pressure that the US administration applied on
Israel, arguing that that pressure would not yield the desired results. Ross believed that the
administration would be better served by ""working with the Israelis and understanding them

better,"" said one source in Jerusalem. An alternate position was maintained by Mitchell and
Rudman, who believed that it would be advisable to pressure Netanyahu. It now appears that
Ross's approach has prevailed, and that the administration is going to replace the people who
guided the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
As Ma 'any reported, Netanyahu is scheduled to fly to New Orleans next week to attend the
general assembly of the Jewish communities, where he will meet Vice President Joe Biden. From
there, Netanyahu will make a short visit to New York, where he will meet other Jewish leaders
and will give interviews to the American media.
Netanyahu is not going to meet President Obama this time, despite intense efforts that were
made by his office to arrange such a meeting. The reason the two men are not going to meet is
that President Obama is scheduled to leave for long trip to India, Indonesia and South Korea on
the day that Netanyahu arrives. One observer in Washington said: ""Obama ran as far away from
Bibi as possible in order to avoid a meeting with him. If he could, Obama would take a space
ship to Mars.""
Netanyahu decided to defy protocol and to go to the United States in any event, Obama's
absence notwithstanding.

Can the Dude Abide?
By MAUREEN DOWD
WASHINGTON
Barack Obama became president by brilliantly telling his own story. To stay president, he will need to show he
can understand our story.
At first it was exciting that Obama was the sort of brainy, cultivated Democrat who would be at home in a
""West Wing"" episode.
But now he acts like he really thinks he's on ""West Wing,"" gliding through an imaginary, amber-lit set where
his righteous self-regard is bound to be rewarded by the end of the hour.
Hey, dude, you're a politician. Act like one.
As the head of the Democratic Party, the president should have supported the Democratic candidate for
governor in Rhode Island, the one the Democratic Governors Association had already lavished more than $1
million in TV ads on. If Obama was going to refuse to endorse Frank Caprio out of respect for Lincoln Chafee,
the former Republican who endorsed him for president and is now running as an independent, the president
should have at least stayed out of Providence.
Reductio ad absurdum: After two years of taking his base for granted, the former Pied Piper of America's youth
had to spar with Jon Stewart to try to get the attention of young people who once idolized him.
Obama still has the killer smile, but he's more often sniffy than funny. When Stewart called White House
legislation ""timid,"" Obama got defensive and offered a less-than-thrilling new mantra: ""Yes, we can but ...""
""We have done things that people don't even know about,"" said Obama, who left his Great Communicator
mantle back in Grant Park on election night.

In 2008, the message was him. The promise was him. And that's why 2010 is a referendum on him.
With his coalition and governing majority shattering around him, President Obama will have to summon
political skills — starting Wednesday — that he has not yet shown he has.
His arrogance led him to assume: If I build it, they will understand. He can't get the gratitude he feels he
deserves for his achievements if no one knows what he achieved and why those achievements are so vital.
Once it seemed impressive that he was so comfortable in his own skin. Now that comfort comes across as an
unwillingness to be wrong.
We want the best people to govern us, but many voters are so turned off by Obama's superior air that they're
rushing into the arms of disturbingly inferior pols.
Obama admitted to The Times's Peter Baker: ""There is probably a perverse pride in my administration — and I
take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top — that we were going to do the right thing, even if
short term it was unpopular.""
But who defines what's ""right""?
With the exception of Obama, most Americans seemed to agree that the ""right"" thing to do until the economy
recovered was to focus on jobs instead of getting the Congress mired for months in making over health
insurance and energy policy. And the ""right"" thing to do was to come down harder on the big banks for
spending on bonuses instead of lending to small businesses that don't get bailouts.
Many of us thought the ""right"" thing to do was to ratify the civil rights of gay Americans in marriage and the
military. (A new Pentagon study shows that most U.S. troops and their families don't care if gays are allowed to
serve openly.)
In an interview with progressive bloggers, the president was asked why he was lagging behind Republicans like
Ted Olson on gay marriage.
Noting that he has a lot of friends and staffers in committed gay relationships, Obama conceded only that his
attitude was evolving. ""I think it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going,"" the president said.
Trend lines? Really inspiring, dude.
One top aide told me that the president — who perversely tried to marginalize a once-captivated press corps —
was beginning to realize that he had not used his charm as effectively as he could have.
His inner circle believed too much in the power of the Aura and in protecting the Brand. They didn't think they
needed to sell anything or fight back when the crazies started sliming them. They didn't care that the average
citizen needed an M.B.A. to understand the financial plan and a Ph.D. to fathom what the health care plan
would mean.
Because Obama stayed above it all on health care and delegated to Max Baucus, he missed the moment in
August of 2009 when Sarah Palin and the Tea Party got oxygen with their loopy rants on death panels. It never
occurred to the Icon that such wildness and gullibility would trump lofty rationality.
As the president tries to ride the Tea Party tiger, let's hope for this change: that he puts some audacity in his
audacity.

Subject: (AP) Saudi king transfers National Guard duties to son
RIYADH (AP) - The Saudi king stepped down as head of the country's National Guard and transferred the influential
position to his son, in an apparent sign that the elderly monarch is beginning to lessen his duties. The Saudi Press
Agency reported that King Abdullah has named Prince Mitab bin Abdullah as commander of the National Guard. King
Abdullah had headed the force since 1962. The 86-year-old king also handed over his traditional supervisory duties for
the annual hajj pilgrimage to his deputy prime minister because doctors advised him to rest after rupturing a disc in his
back. Abdullah appeared on Saudi television receiving well-wishers for the Eid al-Adha holiday.

The Education of a President
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, ""The
Clinton Tapes,"" Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. ""I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,"" Obama told me, ""and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy.""
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. ""There is an anti-
establishment mood,"" Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. ""We just happen to be here when the music is stopping.""
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)

The Education of a President
By PETER BAKER
On a busy afternoon in the West Wing late last month, President Barack Obama seemed relaxed and unhurried
as he sat down in a newly reupholstered brown leather chair in the Oval Office. He had just returned from the
East Room, where he signed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 — using eight pens so he could give away as
many as possible. The act will be his administration's last piece of significant economic legislation before
voters deliver their verdict on his first two years in office. For all intents and purposes, the first chapter of
Obama's presidency has ended. On Election Day, the next chapter will begin.
As he welcomed me, I told him I liked what he had done with the place. Gone was George W. Bush's yellow
sunburst carpet (it says ""optimistic person,"" Bush would tell practically anyone who visited), and in its place
was a much-derided earth-tone rug with inspirational quotations. The curved walls now had striped tan
wallpaper, and the coffee table had been replaced by a walnut-and-mica table that, Obama noted, would resist
stains from water glasses. The bust of Winston Churchill was replaced by one of Martin Luther King Jr. The
couches were new. He told me he was happy with the redecorating of the office. ""I know Arianna doesn't like
it,"" he said lightly. ""But I like taupe.""
If there was something incongruous about the president of the United States checking out reviews of his decor
by Arianna Huffington, well, let's face it, he has endured worse reviews lately. The president who muscled
through Congress perhaps the most ambitious domestic agenda in a generation finds himself vilified by the
right, castigated by the left and abandoned by the middle. He heads into the final stretch of the midterm
campaign season facing likely repudiation, with voters preparing to give him a Congress that, even if Democrats
maintain control, will almost certainly be less friendly to the president than the one he has spent the last two
years mud wrestling.
While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong — and what he needs to
do to change course for the next two years. He has spent what one aide called ""a lot of time talking about
Obama 2.0"" with his new interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and his deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. During
our hour together, Obama told me he had no regrets about the broad direction of his presidency. But he did
identify what he called ""tactical lessons."" He let himself look too much like ""the same old tax-and-spend liberal
Democrat."" He realized too late that ""there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects"" when it comes to public
works. Perhaps he should not have proposed tax breaks as part of his stimulus and instead ""let the Republicans
insist on the tax cuts"" so it could be seen as a bipartisan compromise.
Most of all, he has learned that, for all his anti-Washington rhetoric, he has to play by Washington rules if he
wants to win in Washington. It is not enough to be supremely sure that he is right if no one else agrees with
him. ""Given how much stuff was coming at us,"" Obama told me, ""we probably spent much more time trying to
get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration
— and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top — that we were going to do the right thing,
even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that
success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and
P.R. and public opinion.""
That presumes that what he did was the right thing, a matter of considerable debate. The left thinks he did too
little; the right too much. But what is striking about Obama's self-diagnosis is that by his own rendering, the
figure of inspiration from 2008 neglected the inspiration after his election. He didn't stay connected to the

people who put him in office in the first place. Instead, he simultaneously disappointed those who considered
him the embodiment of a new progressive movement and those who expected him to reach across the aisle to
usher in a postpartisan age. On the campaign trail lately, Obama has been confronted by disillusionment — the
woman who was ""exhausted"" defending him, the mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking
for work. Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued ""Hope"" poster, says he's losing hope.
Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008,
he told an admiring crowd that someday ""we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the
moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the
rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and
secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth.""
I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying
governance. ""It sounds ambitious,"" he agreed. ""But you know what? We've made progress on each of those
fronts."" He quoted Mario Cuomo's line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. ""But the prose and
the poetry match up,"" he said. ""It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama
didn't do what he's promised. I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. But I keep
a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we
talked about during the campaign. And I hope as long as I'm president, I've got a chance to work on the other
30 percent.""
But save the planet? If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save
the planet? He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. ""I make no apologies for having set high
expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations,"" he said. ""Now,
the one thing that I will say — which I anticipated and can be tough — is the fact that in a big, messy
democracy like this, everything takes time. And we're not a culture that's built on patience.""
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, ""The
Clinton Tapes,"" Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. ""I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,"" Obama told me, ""and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy.""
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. ""There is an anti-
establishment mood,"" Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. ""We just happen to be here when the music is stopping.""
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two
dozen of his advisers — some of whom spoke with permission, others without — hoping to understand how the
situation looks to them. The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the

worst problems of any president in years. Or in generations. Or in American history. He prevented another
Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. But it required him to do
unpopular things that would inevitably cost him.
""He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic,"" Pete
Rouse told me. Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign,
said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the
severity of his challenges. ""I told him at some point that at the end of '10, his approval rating could be low- to
mid-30s,"" Plouffe told me.
Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. Many officials
worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. They talk about whether it is time
to move on. While not in the 30s, Obama's approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office —just a point above where
Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans
lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. Joel Benenson, Obama's pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent,
the president's popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American
life. ""We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution,"" he said, ""and President
Obama still stands above that."" Obama's team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises
he laid out as pillars of his ""new foundation"" in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University — health care,
education reform and financial reregulation. And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while
escalating the war in Afghanistan. ""History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,""
Rouse says.
But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. In their darkest moments, White House
aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he
signs. Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in
collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a
societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new
spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another
Abraham Lincoln after all. In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern
president is going to be, at best, average.
""We're all a lot more cynical now,"" one aide told me. The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White
House aides do that with exuberance. But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led
them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. ""It's not that we believed our own press or press
releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington,"" another
White House official told me. ""'Arrogance' isn't the right word, but we were overconfident.""
The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a
polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. While Republican leaders resolved to stand against
Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. ""If anybody thought the
Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken,"" former Senator Tom Daschle, a
mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. ""I'm not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind
of hoped the Republicans would go away. And obviously they didn't do that.""
Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama's ally from Illinois, said the
Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. ""I think his fate was sealed,"" Durbin said. ""Once
the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged
it out for a longer period of time. The American people have a limited attention span. Once you convince them
there's a problem, they want a solution.""

Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being
more nimble in the face of opposition. ""B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments,"" he told me, ""and a
D-plus or C-minus on communication."" The health care legislation is ""an incredible achievement"" and the
stimulus program was ""absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful,"" in Rendell's judgment, yet Obama
allowed them to be tarnished by critics. ""They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they
lost it early,"" said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. ""We didn't
use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle.""
That's a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it's a communication problem. The first refuge of any
politician in trouble is that it's a communication problem, not a policy problem. If only I explained what I was
doing better, the people would be more supportive. Which roughly translates to If only you people paid
attention, you wouldn't be kicking me upside the head. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed
at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. ""I haven't been at a policy-
problem meeting in 20 months,"" he noted.
The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory — he is a liberal zealot, in the view
of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy
with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush's unrelenting antiterror tactics at
the expense of civil liberties.
""When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American
people in our governing institutions,"" says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who
voted for Obama in 2008. ""What we now know is that that did not work. If anything, people are even more
dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. So to that extent, the transformational side has not
worked. And frankly I would settle these days — forget about transformational, how about a transactional
president, somebody people could do business with? It seems there's an ideological rigidity that the American
people did not sense.""
The other side would like more ideological rigidity. Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the
president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has ""totally blown this great opportunity"" to reinvent
America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. Other liberals feel the same way
about gays in the military or the prison at Guantanamo Bay. ""It's been so reflexive since he was elected, to just
give ground and give ground,"" Solomon told me. ""If we don't call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word,
he just seems to be backpedaling."" Solomon added: ""It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. People just
feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he's behaved in
office.""
Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. At a Labor Day event in
Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. ""They're not always happy with me,"" he
told supporters. ""They talk about me like a dog — that's not in my prepared remarks, but it's true.""
The friendly fire may bother him even more. ""Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,""
Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. ""If we get an historic health care bill passed —
oh, well, the public option wasn't there. If you get the financial reform bill passed — then, well, I don't know
about this particular derivatives rule, I'm not sure that I'm satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven't yet brought
about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker.""
Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. As he
pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: ""It took time to free
the slaves. It took time for women to get the vote. It took time for workers to get the right to organize.""

One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama's administration, the president and his top aides gathered for
their morning meeting in the Oval Office. As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone
noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. ""The number of
people who don't pay their taxes,"" he answered sardonically.
From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern —
not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that
hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. Obama trusted his
judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense
of integrity — and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him.
Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only
to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. While Obama was a senator
when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. ""The
story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington,
gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was,"" a senior aide told me. ""Here's a guy who
ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were
going to have to work with Washington to fix that.""
Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. When he
emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television
in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. ""He's still never
gotten comfortable here,"" a top White House official told me. He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a
senior adviser, calls ""the inevitable theatrics of Washington.""
But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly.
His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no
matter that it was paid for by private funds. On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as
if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and
one day he showed up wearing one. Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the
White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren't sure he's Christian; sure enough, a few
weeks later, he attended services at St. John's Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow.
Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. He seemed to believe he could
overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world's most recalcitrant figures — whether they be the mullahs
in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to
meet in his first year with some of America's enemies ""without precondition"" has met with none of them. And
the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both
parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often.
He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. During the health care debate, Obama
had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old
business as usual. ""Perhaps we were naïve,"" Axelrod told me. ""First, he's always had good relations across
party lines. And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other
side of the aisle to help deal with it. I don't think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we
confronted."" Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. ""Part of what they were
doing was not just making us grind it out,"" he told me. ""They were souring the country on the mood of the
country.""
Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials
thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their
chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
Street special interests. At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials
said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes.
Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from
the outside. As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget
director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had
become. ""I'd thought it was an 8, but it's more like a 10,"" he told me. ""And rather than wasting time debating
whether it's legitimate,"" he added, referring to his former colleagues, ""the key is to recognize that it's affecting
what they do.""
Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across
as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be
draining. He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group
settings can be harder for him. Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East
Room event so he can gather his energy again. Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to
work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. That's what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. When Obama
addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his
aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. He is not much for chitchat. When he and I sat
down, he started our session matter-of-factly: ""All right,"" he said, ""fire away.""
By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. ""Zen"" is the word commonly used in
the West Wing. That's not to say he never loses his temper. He has been known to snap at aides when he feels
overscheduled. He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy ""I've
already read that."" He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show
up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. He was subdued during the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but
Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an
urban guy. He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. ""Come on, man, you've got to make that
shot,"" he chides aides who play with him.
The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. ""He'll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I've noticed
he's gotten a little grayer,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. ""These kinds of decisions
do that to people."" But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. ""We usually will talk about writing the
condolence letters,"" Gates added. ""But other than that, we don't dwell on it."" If anything, Obama more often
than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they
will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big.
While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches
outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as
a handful of personal friends. ""He's opaque even to us,"" an aide told me. ""Except maybe for a few people in the
inner circle, he's a closed book."" In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address.
On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a
trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin
Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. (When I asked if he had an iPad,
Obama said, ""I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place."")
Jarrett attributes Obama's equilibrium to his upbringing. ""He's really different,"" she told me. ""It's rooted in his
sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community
organizer."" As Gibbs put it: ""He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. It's
not to say that he's immune from criticism. But he can categorize in his head the difference between what's a
setback, what's a bump along the way and what's just noise.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
There is certainly no shortage of noise. But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his
old spirit again. He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. ""That's the
happiest I've seen him in a long time,"" an aide said. After one, Obama told the aide, ""This reminds me of Iowa
on the bus.""
Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. After all, those were the
romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear
up over the promise of what will be. But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories
really are. ""The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake,
that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step,"" he told me. ""And somehow now, as
president, things are messy and they don't always work as planned and people are mad at us. That's not how I
look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. And it was just as messy and just as difficult.
And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren't going to win.
And we're going through that same period here.""
In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different
circumstances — Clinton's impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House
intern, Bush's drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama's struggle to turn
around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are starkly variable crises, but some
dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they
argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it's almost always a mixture of both; they
acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against
public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their
opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.
Talking with Obama and his aides, it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues
never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists
will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick
problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections,
Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, ""They're not
serious."" In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase ""they're not serious"" four times in
referring to Republican budget plans.
That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside, Obama at
times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual
underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides
express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush, once he has made a
decision, Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview
a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton
Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another
journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency,
until they wore it comfortably.
As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win
re-election, the lessons differ. In Reagan's case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first
two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was
strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic
leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-
piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when
he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors,
particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the
partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so
he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. ""He's no
Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle,"" says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich
adviser. ""I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism."" Ken Duberstein likewise doubts
Obama's capacity for adjustment. ""They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing,"" he
said.
Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a
second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after
nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but
went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later,
Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before
losing to Clinton in 1992.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)
As the first African-American president, Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he
also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. ""History
never precisely repeats itself,"" Obama told me. ""But there is a pattern in American presidencies — at least
modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially, having been beaten,
says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the
campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington.
People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say, This is the same
old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the
confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit.""
To better understand history, and his role in it, Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in
May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about, among other things, the Tea Party
movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and
how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Populists in
the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. ""He listened,"" the historian H. W. Brands told me. ""What
he concluded, I don't know.""
Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that ""Washington is even more broken than we
thought,"" as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale
back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change
the dynamics of governance. ""One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for
him with the American people,"" the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. ""He's so good in front of an
audience, and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras
doesn't really do that.""
As we talked in the Oval Office, Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives,
necessary as they may have been, wore on the public. ""That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in
and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people,"" he told me. ""They
started feeling like: Gosh, here we are tightening our belts, we're cutting out restaurants, we're cutting out our

gym membership, in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in
Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.
""And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway, which was Obama is not a
different kind of Democrat — he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.""
Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. ""The seeds of his
political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps,"" he said. White House officials largely agree they
should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never
come. ""It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do, to be legislator in chief,"" a top
adviser told me. ""It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy."" Plouffe agreed
that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. ""When you swim in those waters, you're
going to be affected by that,"" he said. ""I do think he's paid a political price, somewhat, for having to be tied to
Congress.""
Still, for all the second-guessing, what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic
elements of the program — Obama aides, liberal and moderate alike, reject complaints from the right that the
stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much, as well as complaints
from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care
option. ""We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with,"" Larry Summers, the outgoing national economics
adviser, told me. ""But we fought as hard as we could, and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going
to give us at that time.""
And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. ""There's all this talk in this town — if we
had done energy before health care, if we had focused more on small business, if we had done an Oval on the
economy instead of Iraq, we would be doing better,"" Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, says. ""I don't
believe that. We could always do things differently, and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't
know they'd change the overall trend.""
Melody Barnes, the president's domestic-policy adviser, says the biggest problem was that after eight years of
Bush, Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. ""The pent-up demand across every
issue area — around science, around education, around health care, immigration, you name it — there was a lot
of desire to finally get these things done,"" she told me. ""Every segment of the population had something that
was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line.""
Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's
problem is that he is not insecure — he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels
the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time, frenetically wooing lawmakers, power
brokers, adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.
Instead, what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is ""not on the level."" That's a phrase
commonly used around the West Wing — ""it's not on the level."" By that, they mean the Republicans, the news
media, the lobbyists, the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge, as
they see it, is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture
Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time, as Emanuel told me, ""We have to play
the game.""
As Brands, the historian, put it, ""It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can
have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective.""
""I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president."" So Obama told Diane
Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point, just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the

Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy, costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of
the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.
It's a good line, but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third, it
starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that
will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does
not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside
politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater
economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).
But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the
midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit
with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while
raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political
danger, back on the table. ""If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff,"" he told
me, ""the answer is no.""
Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same
as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about
2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican
nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palmn will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican
nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today, some
in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas
governor.
With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next
phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among
those who wanted to leave — for years, he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to
Obama. Indeed, when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year,
Messina bet him $400 that he would not. ""We'll see what happens,"" Rouse told me when I asked about the bet
last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm
Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn
off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job, running Obama's presidential
library.
Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new
national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a
new national-security adviser, among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's
re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.
""There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal
communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative,"" said one aide
familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his
advisers. ""He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction,"" the aide said. ""He doesn't like confrontation.""
But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more
continuity than change.
Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to
include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly
even producing scaled-back energy legislation. ""You'll hear more about exports and less about public
spending,"" a senior White House official said. ""You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less

about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government
as a hirer.""
Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm
elections. ""It may be that regardless of what happens after this election, they feel more responsible,"" he said,
""either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated, and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and
sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them, or they did reasonably well, in which case the
American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way.""
I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he
came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce
secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was
Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for
reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart, but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself
in a young, substantive policy thinker.
Even if such an alliance emerges, though, the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in
his first two years — and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. ""Even if! had the exact
same Congress, even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House, I think the
rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years,"" Obama
told me. ""There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that
new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended.""
As a senior adviser put it, ""There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless
there's some sort of crisis."" Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. ""It's fair to
assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years,"" Plouffe told me. ""His
view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners."" Before he left, Emanuel told me: ""I'm not of the view
that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda.""
But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative, say some advisers. ""It will have to be limited
and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people,"" Dick Durbin told
me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. ""The lessons of the last two years are
going to be critical,"" he told me. ""The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive.""
Rendell thinks otherwise. ""Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to
cooperate,"" he advised. ""Do what you have to do. Fight back."" At the same time, he said, stop moaning about
what he inherited: ""After the election, I'd say no more pointing back, no more blaming the Bush administration.
It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it, it sounds like a broken
record. And after two years, you own it.""
Obama will own it for another two years, or six if he can find his way forward. As an author, Obama
appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist, really? At bottom, this president is
still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign, he sold himself— or the idea of himself— more than
any particular policy, and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was, as he said at the time, the ultimate
Rorschach test.
Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes, he further defines himself for better
or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the
hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and
his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia, ""I start slow, but I finish strong.""
He will have to, if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.

Dear Capricia,
As time moves on, I realize I haven't seen you and Mrs. Clinton (Hillary) in a long time, but I think of you both often. I
don't know if movie producers are still worthy in your world, but next time you're in NYC I'd love to see you.
I have such fond memories of you guys watching SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. I made another movie you might like about the
ascendancy of King George after Edward abdicated, it's called KINGS SPEECH. The movie brings to light something that
many people don't know, which is that King George was a stutterer and he hired an actor to try and help him overcome
it. It's a fun movie that is much in the tradition of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, again I think you would both like it (and
Hillary would approve because it's PG-13 with not too many swear words).
If you have any trips coming up I'd love to send it to you so you guys can watch and give me your opinion. I could also
include a copy of THE TILLMAN STORY, that one is obviously not a happy film, but it's an incredibly important one.
PS
Your bad friend,
Harvey

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft struck targets in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants fired a
rocket from the territory into Israel, security officials and witnesses said. Early September 4, Gaza militants fired a
rocket into southern Israel, causing no injuries, the Israeli military said. Hours later, witnesses and Hamas security
officials said Israeli aircraft fired rockets at targets in Gaza, including smuggling tunnels along the border with Egypt. At
least two people were wounded, medical workers said.

We've been in touch with Ambassador Susan Jacobs--she is on the road now, but I understand that she did speak with

Someone is apparently providing the Bower family with misinformed ""readouts"" of both the Secretary's meeting with

""readouts"" do not/not conform with what we understand actually took place. We do not know the source of this

There is no/no indication that the GOE intends to intervene in the judicial process which has yet to fully hear Mr.
Bower's legal challenge to his wife's Egyptian custody order. As I read the read-out of Sen Kerry call to President
Mubarak (forwarded in separate email), Mubarak said he could not intervene in the judicial process.
The next hearing is set for October.
A meeting on Sept 20th has been set for Mr. Bowers, the Egyptian ""Good Intentions Committee""
which is an extra-judicial group of officials who try to facilitate resolution of custody cases involving foreign parents (but
the committee has no authority to order the children's return to Mr. Bowers), and the ex-wife, and possibly the children.
We have been urging the GOE to assure that the boys are available to see their father on the 20th. We do not expect
that the boys will be released to him and do not understand how the family came to believe this.

Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is headed to Cairo on Monday to
pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As
you can imagine the family is really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice here, because I have no idea
what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for getting us this far. Howard

Daily Herald Editorial Board
Published: 8/26/2010 12:05 AM
Today marks a watershed moment in our nation's history.
Know what it is? Any plans to celebrate the occasion? Ninety years ago this day, the United States
secretary of state signed into law the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right
to vote.
That significant moment in history securing that basic civil right for one of the two genders in
existence came after a more than 70-year struggle that saw pioneering ""radical"" women jailed and
physically abused as they fought for justice.
Ninety years ago today. Not all that long ago, really. We still have women among us who lived during
a time when this basic but powerful activity was prohibited. Denied to their mothers and
grandmothers, older sisters and aunts.
Illinois played a pivotal role in the struggle, and Illinois and suburban women continue to mark our
history, politics and policy. And they should continue to by exercising their right, speaking out and
working to change policies that affect us all.
Illinois did not allow women to vote in presidential and local elections until 1913 and, according to
votingwomen.org, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were the first three states to ratify the 19th
Amendment on June 10, 1919.
From the start, Illinois and its suburbs have been home to pioneering women. Libertyville's Clara
Colby is listed as the first woman to vote, having cast a ballot for a new town hall while, papers at the
time reported, her husband stayed home to ""scrub clothes in the laundry.""
There is Jane Addams, the Cedarville, III., native social worker and suffragist who founded Chicago's
Hull House and was one of the first women to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
And Illinois has elected 14 female members of Congress. The first was Chicago Republican Winnifred
S. Huck, only the third woman elected to Congress, just two years after the 19th Amendment
ratification. Huck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. Republican Ruth Hanna
McCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to vote
in some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress. Democrat Emily Taft Douglas, an early
leader of the League of Women Voters and an internationalist who was the wife of former U.S. Sen.
Paul Douglas and a cousin to President William H. Taft, beat isolationist Republican Stephen Day in
1945, according to the Women in Congress website.
In more recent times, Rockford Republican Lynn Martin moved from Congress to Labor Secretary
and Chicago Democrat Carol Moseley Braun became the first black woman in the U.S. Senate. Now,
of course, we also have Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hails from Park Ridge. In the suburban
trenches all along the way, women have been leading and agitating for change. Former Democratic
state Rep. Eugenia Chapman of Arlington Heights is credited with helping start community colleges in
Illinois. Republican Giddy Dyer of Hinsdale joined her in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment and
also passed DuPage County's first clean air ordinance. Chapman worked with Republican Virginia B.
Macdonald of Arlington Heights to establish a women's center at Harper College. And omit goes.
Nice, you say, but big deal? Indeed, they were a big deal and, indeed, women shaping our lives still
are a big deal. Men, can you imagine your life without women? Women, can you imagine your life
without other women? American women have come a long way in 90 years and society is the better
for it. Women vote in greater numbers than men and have for years, nationally and in Illinois. They
very well can and should vote, write laws, lead and play even more influential roles in what the next
90 years, and beyond, may bring us all.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771411 Date: 08/31/2015

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate confirmed Jacob Lew as director of the Office of Management and Budget after a
Louisiana senator lifted a hold on his nomination. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu had held up Lew's confirmation to
protest the administration's six-month moratorium on deepwater oil and gas drilling in the Gulf. She said that ""notable
progress has been made"" in her talks with the Interior Department and noted some permits have been issued in recent
weeks. The nomination was confirmed by voice vote.

Elections
With some 20 seats still undecided, Republicans have already picked up 61 seats in House; Democrats likely to
keep 51-53 seats in Senate. Spratt and Skelton losses are among more significant; H will prepare an analysis of
election's impact on our oversight committees. Murkowski appears to be headed for historic write-in win; her
support of Law of Sea and likely sympathy for New START will be good for us. Reid will likely return to
Washington energized by win to pursue consequential lame duck session. Manchin and Kirk will take up their
seats in the Senate this month; Rich suggests S calls to each to help lock in support for New START.
Other Congressional Issues
Tom Nides' prep going well, and he'll see SFRC members and Sem Gilibrand this week. Rich expects
committee will vote him out during lame duck; still unclear if we'll get floor vote. An inter-agency team will
brief the Hill this week on the President's Asia trip. Kerry will leave for the Middle East, including Syria, on
Sunday.
Guantanamo Closure
Dal is considering Harold's latest paper on the way forward.
Iran
Kouchner announced after conversation with Iranian FM Mottaki that adultery convict Ashtiani will not be
imminently executed, as earlier reported. Jundullah designation being announced this morning.
India
Roemer and Blake making good progress on nuclear liability issue, but we are not yet ready to raise public
expectations.
Iraq
Press reports about Inspector General's report on mil-civ transition mistakenly suggest that State had been
unaware of associated challenges.

Dear Richard:

1.4(D)
In the past two months, the TAPI project has been resuscitated, largely due to Turkmen President
Berdimukhamedov's personal outreach to his counterparts in Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi. A ""Heads of
Agreement"" for the project was recently signed, and there is a possibility that the heads of state of the four
participant countries will meet in Ashgabat in December to give further political impetus to the project. As a
result, the Asian Development Bank, has now
reengaged on the project, and has just agreed to fund technical assistance to the Afghan Ministry of Mines to
assist in negotiations with the other TAPI partners.
I have met twice with Turkmen President Berdimukhamedov since August, and TAPI is at the top of his
agenda.
We all recognize the significant hurdles that TAPI faces, both from a security and commercial standpoint,
but we believe we should do what we can to encourage forward movement on the project:
I have also made General
Petraeus aware of the above.

Mark,
You've probably heard that a bomb went off thisd morning in Laghman province, Aghanistan. The Governor of the
province is in Madrid at the end of a one-week visit to Poland, Germany, and Spain.
His message has been of support for ISAF and international development, which is helping Afghanistan defeat the enemy,
confront radical terrorists, and rebuild.
The Governor is considering release of a a statement from Madrid to news outlets this afternoon. We have offered
assistance in reaching media. Will keep you posted.
Please share this info, as appropriate, with those who should know in the Dept.
FOR KABUL:
While it appears that Insurgents hoped to capitalize on the NATO summit to send a message, and likely chose Laghman
because of it has been relatively peaceful and secure, this incident underscores the Governor's talking points that, while
Laghman has been peaceful and made great progress on all fronts in the past 9 years, Afghanstan still needs security and
development assistance to defeat the terrorists, who only bring destruction, fear, and oppression.

press staff wants to coordinate with you on press availability and ground rules. If you agree, I would like to put you
directly in contact with them to work out the details. If you prefer, we can operate as a filter for you, but with the event

under fire near the village of Tantil in Pech district. When coalition forces returned fire, three or four rounds landed
short of the target area, near a village, killing and wounding the civilians November 19. NATO spokesman U.S. Army Col.
Rafael Torres said the coalition does everything within its power to prevent civilian casualties in the course of
operations, but in this case it failed. The coalition expressed condolences to the families.

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles.""
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish
capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting
the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012.""
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says.
""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's
rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says.
Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them
the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out
between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly
Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of
trying to build a new coalition government.
Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual
caricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American right
is much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers
more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation
to help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to public
services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""access for all to
the same level of health care.""
Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by
competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the
family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was
brought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician
sent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.""
That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential
race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles.""
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish
capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting
the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012.""
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says.
""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's

I would say that: There appears to be misinformation circulating. While sympathetic to all parties, the GOE has not
indicated any willingness to interfere in the proceedings of the Egyptian courts that currently are considering Mr.
Bower's challenge to the Egyptian custody decree. We do not know when that judicial process will be completed,
although the next hearing is scheduled for October. The Embassy is currently trying to assure that Mr. Bower, who is en
route to Egypt now, will be able to see his sons as called for in a current Egyptian court order.

outside the State Dept. Don't know if the Secretary was aware of the back channel discussions
at the time she raised the case. Mubarak apparently feels no one has responded to his wish

Subject: (AP) Peace talks come and go, but a settlement grows
REVAVA (AP) - The American president was pushing hard for a Mideast peace agreement when six Jewish families
arrived on this West Bank hilltop early one morning with cribs, refrigerators, Israeli flags and flatbed trucks carrying
mobile homes.
White House condemnation came quickly: ""Settlements are an obstacle to peace and their continuation does not
contribute to the development of a peace process which we have all been working toward.""
It was April 16, 1991.
Since then peace talks have started, stopped, restarted, and now it's President Barack Obama's turn to feel frustrated.
Last week Israel ended its temporary settlement freeze, Palestinians threatened to quit the talks Obama has brokered,
and settlers were celebrating in Revava, where those first trailers have been replaced by red-roofed suburban homes
and six families have become 250.
The story is the same across the West Bank, where settlements have evolved from tenuous Jewish footholds into a
massive presence across the hilly country which Israel captured in the 1967 war and which Palestinians want for their
own state.
They have grown steadily through years of international condemnation, diplomacy, periods of violence and
negotiations. They have often expanded as a direct protest against negotiations and the possibility that an Israeli
government might uproot them.
In 1991, when the first Bush administration was coaxing Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table, 90,300
Israelis lived in settlements across the West Bank. Today there are 300,000, and their population is growing by 5 percent
a year, more than 2 1/2 times the growth rate inside Israel.
The settlements themselves, ranging from small cities to isolated enclaves, take up just one percent of the area of the
West Bank, according to government maps analyzed by Israeli human rights campaigners. But their impact is much
greater than that number would suggest; the settlements and their access roads form a web of Israeli control that
Palestinians say rules out any chance of viable statehood.
Nowhere is the expansion, and its interplay with the politics of peacemaking, more apparent than at Revava.
When those first families arrived on this rocky hill next to the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares, President George H. W.
Bush's secretary of state, James Baker, was en route to Israel on a round of shuttle diplomacy.
One settler leader, Daniella Weiss, told The Associated Press at the time that they had ""hurried the decision"" on
Revava to undermine Baker's plans.
Government permits had been issued and the land, settlers said, had been quietly purchased from local Palestinians.
The Israeli government was led, as it is now, by the Likud Party, historically a champion of West Bank settlement,
claiming the territory as part of the biblical Land of Israel promised by God and as indispensable to Israel's security.
Some ministers in the government of then-prime minister Yitzhak Shamir reacted sourly to Revava's establishment;
the government was trying to mollify the U.S. and appear receptive to peace while simultaneously settling Jews in the
West Bank according to its own master plan. But the balancing act was becoming increasingly precarious.
Israeli doves were furious about Revava. Lawmaker Yossi Sand likened it to ""planting a bomb aboard (Baker's) plane in
order to blow up his mission.""
The settlers were young couples raised in observant Jewish homes. Gideon and Miri Goldis arrived with boxes of

possessions and three children under age 3. Nineteen years later, the family lives in a neat stucco home and have nine
children.
""I had the good fortune to come to a rocky, empty hilltop and start a Zionist settlement enterprise that my
grandfather could only dream of. Suddenly there was another ZIP code in the post office and another place on the map,""
Gideon Goldis said last week.
""I don't know what Baker wanted, or what Obama wants now, or any other leader - these are secondary,"" he said.
""What comes first is my people, their birthright and their security.""
Since the Goldises arrived, six Israeli prime ministers have held peace talks with the Palestinians. Some have officially
restricted settlement construction. Through all of this, Revava has kept growing.
Settlements sometimes went up with the intention of forestalling concessions and in response to international
pressure, said Israeli writer Gershom Gorenberg, who has documented the history of the settlement movement.
""The red-tiled houses on the hilltops remain as monuments to the fallen peace initiatives of the past,"" he said in an
interview.
Unlike the Likud leaders of two decades ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he accepts Palestinian
statehood in at least part of the West Bank. But the Palestinian leadership sees settlement construction as the true
litmus test of Israeli intentions, and insists the freeze must be maintained.
The settlers see themselves as the aggrieved party, at odds with the Palestinians, the White House, and often their
own government. At Revava's celebrations last week, a sign with Obama's picture referenced the controversy over the
planned Islamic center near Ground Zero in Manhattan, saying: ""If Islam can build anywhere, why can't I?""
Gideon Goldis' father, Avraham, was a metallurgical engineer in Philadelphia before he immigrated to Israel. In 2000
he followed his son to Revava.
Beyond ideology, he said, he found a close-knit community 10 minutes' drive from central Israel. A house in Revava
costs about $270,000, he said, a fraction of the price in Israel's center.
""The Americans said, 'you're torpedoing our efforts,"" said Goldis, 73. ""We say, 'we're coming to live in Israel, why
can't we live wherever we want?""
Two decades after Baker's trip, with a new push under way for a peace agreement that would require Israel to cede
most or all of the West Bank, is Goldis concerned about Revava's future?
""I'm not worried at all,"" he said.

Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. Groups
Begins
By MICHAEL LUO
In what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political
operative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set
up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside
groups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children,
has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely
nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.
Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell
fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads
Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who
gave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.
Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to
set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will
be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.
Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising
consultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of
the nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.
The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)
nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,
according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained
by The New York Times.
Mr. Brock said that ""money is money,"" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media
spending would be apportioned accordingly.
The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to
establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on the
right as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-
leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant
contributions on the left.
Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after
the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.
But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political
player, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters
umbrella.
Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.
Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1
million to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave more
than $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing.
""My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars
to these types of efforts,"" Mr. Brock said. ""They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical
time.""
There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be
more heavily involved in the 2012 elections.
White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-
leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward such
groups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.
The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as
spending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.
But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of
what was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise
money if the option of offering anonymity is available.
""It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,"" Mr. McKay said.
Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.
On Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund-
raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of
whom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.
No one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an
organization.
Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end
of the first quarter of 2011.
By way of comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House
races this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.
The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusing
on attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House, as a prelude to major spending in 2012.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771674 Date: 08/31/2015

US Election And The Fed
Welcome To The New (Old) World
September 19, 2010
One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more
conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials
on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).
But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and
Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.
Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE
snarkiness) two things should not be lost:
1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda
2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care
legislation Congress pushed through.
All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the
House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of
spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.
Let's start with spending:
The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we
wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us
that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will
be one of the top Republican priorities.
Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do
not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time
money was formally appropriated).
Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has
to pass a ""continuing resolution"" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made
(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing
resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).
Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new
Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but
that would be cutting it close and too cute.
Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be
dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more
moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and
take the hit.
In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to
slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.
The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules
requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels
you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.
Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal
wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to
see one of those).
The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will
accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike
down parts of the health care bill now under appeal.
THE SENATE
While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on
what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.
The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a
glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health
care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.
The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and
regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier
Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into
office).
While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered
more conservative than their predecessors:
1. ck (CO) - likely winner
2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner
3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner
4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner
5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner
6. Portman (OH) -likely winner
7. Coats (IN) - likely winner
8. Paul (KY) - likely winner
9. Miller (AK) - likely winner
10. Lee (UT) - likely winner
11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner
12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner
13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)
14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup
There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races
continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.
These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:
1. DeMint (SC)
2. Coburn (OK)
3. Inhofe (OK)
4. McConnell (KY)
5. Kyl (AZ)
6. McCain (AZ)
7. Thune (SD)
8. Crapo (ID)
9. Vitter (LA)
10. Burr (NC)
One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a
minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road
blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture
impossible on spending bills.
Welcome to the new reality.</pre><br/><b>RawText</b>:<pre>UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771695 Date: 08/31/2015

SEOUL (Reuters) — North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his son and successor Jong-un visited the artillery base from
where shells were fired at a South Korean island just hours before the attack, South Korean media reported on
November 25. North Korea's attack on Yeonpyeong Island that killed two South Korean marines and two civilians
November 22 was probably ordered by Kim Jong-il himself, the Joongang Daily quoted a well-informed government
source as saying. Seoul government officials contacted by Reuters could not comment on the reports. South Korean
media reported the father and son had met General Kim Kyok-sik, the commander of the frontline fourth corps in charge
of a Navy base in South Hwanghae province, just before the North shelled the island. JoongAng Daily quoted a source as
saying that Kim visited the coastal artillery base in Gaemori from where the shells were fired with his son a day before
the attack.

Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.

I've circulated a call sheet for your conversation with Bibi to the group and asked them to look at it tomorrow morning
(no need to make them do it today) so that we can have a consensus recommendation for how you should approach the

New York, NY -- September 20, 2010 — ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor and managing editor Brian Williams
interviewed President Jimmy Carter to discuss the release of his new book ""White House Diary."" The interview
airs tonight on ""NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.""
BRIAN WILLIAMS: The last photo of you with your-- fellow former presidents, you were well off to the side
on the right. And I thought to myself, well, there's-- there's a possible metaphor. (LAUGHTER) What is it--
about you, you think, the way you've-- decided to conduct your life and post-presidency? Do you feel listened
to? Do you feel-- that you receive your due? Or do you feel, in fact, apart from the crowd?
JIMMY CARTER: No. I-- I feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other
presidents. Primarily because of the activism and the-- and the injection of working at the Carter Center and in
international affairs, and to some degree, domestic affairs, on energy conservation, on-- on environment, and
things of that kind. We're right in the midst of the-- of the constant daily debate.
And-- and-- and the Carter Center has decided, under my leadership, to fill vacuums in the world. When-- when
the United States won't deal with troubled areas, we go there and we meet with leaders who can bring an end to
a conflict, or an end to a human rights abuse, and so forth. So I-- I feel that have an advantage over many other
former presidents in being involved in daily affairs that have shaped the policies of our nation and the world.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A leading Republican lawmaker is rejecting the Obama administration's assertion that ratification
of a new arms control treaty with Russia is so pressing that it must be dealt with by the lame-duck Senate. Senator Jon
Kyl of Arizona said Sunday that the Senate has much more urgent business to attend to in the weeks before it breaks for
Christmas. He said the treaty, known as New START, is extremely complex and can wait until the Senate reconvenes
with newly elected members in January. The Obama administration has said ratification is an urgent national security
priority. Kyl said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that delaying a vote would reflect the reality of considering a major treaty in
three weeks amid important domestic issues.

The US Diplomatic Leaks
A Superpower's View of the World
By SPIEGEL Staff
251,000 State Department documents, many of them secret embassy reports from around the world,
show how the US seeks to safeguard its influence around the world. It is nothing short of a political
meltdown for US foreign policy.
What does the United States really think of German Chancellor Angela Merkel? Is she a reliable ally? Did she really
make an effort to patch up relations with Washington that had been so damaged by her predecessor? At most, it was
a half-hearted one.
The tone of trans-Atlantic relations may have improved, former US Ambassador to Germany William Timken wrote in
a cable to the State Department at the end of 2006, but the chancellor ""has not taken bold steps yet to improve the
substantive content of the relationship."" That is not exactly high praise.
And the verdict on German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle? His thoughts ""were short on substance,"" wrote the
current US ambassador in Berlin, Philip Murphy, in a cable. The reason, Murphy suggested, was that ""Westerwelle's
command of complex foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening.""

Such comments are hardly friendly. But in the eyes of the American diplomatic corps, every actor is quickly
categorized as a friend or foe. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia? A friend: Abdullah can't stand his neighbors in Iran and,
expressing his disdain for the mullah regime, said, ""there is no doubt something unstable about them."" And his ally,
Sheikh bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi? Also a friend. He believes ""a near term conventional war with Iran is clearly
preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed Iran.""
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emissaries also learn of a special ""Iran observer"" in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku
who reports on a dispute that played out during a meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. An enraged
Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali Jafari allegedly got into a heated argument with Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad and slapped him in the face because the generally conservative president had, surprisingly, advocated
freedom of the press.
A Political Meltdown
Such surprises from the annals of US diplomacy will dominate the headlines in the coming days when the New York
Times, London's Guardian, Paris' Le Monde, Madrid's El Pais and SPIEGEL begin shedding light on the treasure trove of
secret documents from the State Department. Included are 243,270 diplomatic cables filed by US embassies to the
State Department and 8,017 directives that the State Department sent to its diplomatic outposts around the world. In
the coming days, the participating media will show in a series of investigative stories how America seeks to steer the
world. The development is no less than a political meltdown for American foreign policy.
Never before in history has a superpower lost control of such vast amounts of such sensitive information -- data that
can help paint a picture of the foundation upon which US foreign policy is built. Never before has the trust America's
partners have in the country been as badly shaken. Now, their own personal views and policy recommendations have
been made public -- as have America's true views of them.
For example, one can learn that German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Germany's most beloved
politician according to public opinion polls, openly criticizes fellow cabinet member Guido Westerwelle in conversations
with US diplomats, and even snitches on him. Or that Secretary of State Clinton wants her ambassadors in Moscow
and Rome to inform her whether there is anything to the rumors that Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Vladimir
Putin have private business ties in addition to their close friendship -- whispers that both have vehemently denied.
America's ambassadors can be merciless in their assessments of the countries in which they are stationed. That's their
job. Kenya? A swamp of flourishing corruption extending across the country. Fifteen high-ranking Kenyan officials are
already banned from traveling to the United States, and almost every single sentence in the embassy reports speaks
with disdain of the government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
Weighing Public Interest against Confidentiality
Turkey hardly comes away any less scathed in the cables. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the cables allege,
governs with the help of a cabal of incompetent advisors. Ankara Embassy officials depict a country on a path to an
Islamist future -- a future that likely won't include European Union membership.
As with the close to 92,000 documents on the war in Afghanistan at the end of July and the almost 400,000
documents on the Iraq war recently released, the State Department cables have also been leaked to the WikiLeaks
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015
whistleblower platform -- and they presumably came from the same source. As before, WikiLeaks has provided the
material to media partners to review and analyze them.
With a team of more than 50 reporters and researchers, SPIEGEL has viewed, analyzed and vetted the mass of
documents. In most cases, the magazine has sought to protect the identities of the Americans' informants, unless the
person who served as the informant was senior enough to be politically relevant. In some cases, the US government
expressed security concerns and SPIEGEL accepted a number of such objections. In other cases, however, SPIEGEL
felt the public interest in reporting the news was greater than the threat to security. Throughout our research,
SPIEGEL reporters and editors weighed the public interest against the justified interest of countries in security and
confidentiality.
It is now possible to view many political developments around the world through the lens of those who participated in
those events. As such, our understanding of those events is deeply enriched. That alone is often enough to place
transparency ahead of national regulations regarding confidentiality.
Following the leaks of military secrets from Afghanistan and Iraq, these leaks now put US diplomats on the hot seat. It
is the third coup for WikiLeaks within six months, and it is one that is likely to leave Washington feeling more than a
bit exposed. Around half of the cables that have been obtained aren't classified and slightly less, 40.5 percent, as
classified as ""confidential."" Six percent of the reports, or 16,652 cables, are labelled as ""secret;"" and of those, 4,330
are so explosive that they are labelled ""NOFORN,"" meaning access should not be made available to non-US nationals.
Taken together, the cables provide enough raw text to fill 66 years worth of weekly SPIEGEL magazines.
Gossip and the Unvarnished Truth
Much in the material was noted and sent because those compiling the reports or their dialogue partners believed, with
some certainty, that their transcripts would not be made public for the next 25 years. That may also explain why the
ambassadors and emissaries from Washington were so willing to report gossip and hearsay back to State Department
headquarters. One cable from the Moscow Embassy on Russian first lady Svetlana Medvedev, for example, states that
she is ""generating tensions between the camps and remains the subject of avid gossip."" It then goes on to report that
President Medvedev's wife had already drawn up a list of officials who should be made to ""suffer"" in their careers
because they had been disloyal to Medvedev. Another reports that the wife of Azerbaijan leader Ilham Aliyev has had
so much plastic surgery that it is possible to confuse her for one of her daughters from a distance, but that she can
barely still move her face.
What makes the documents particularly appealing, though, is that many politicians speak the unvarnished truth,
confident as they are that their musings will never be made public.
What, though, do the thousands of documents prove? Do they really show a US which has the world on a leash? Are
Washington's embassies still self-contained power centers in their host countries?
In sum, probably not. In the major crisis regions, an image emerges of a superpower that can no longer truly be
certain of its allies -- like in Pakistan, where the Americans are consumed by fear that the unstable nuclear power
could become precisely the place where terrorists obtain dangerous nuclear material.

There are similar fears in Yemen, where the US, against its better judgement, allows itself to be instrumentalized by
an unscrupulous leader. With American military aid that was intended for the fight against al-Qaida, Ali Abdullah Saleh
is now able to wage his battle against enemy tribes in the northern part of the country.
Insult to Injury
Even after the fall of Saddam Hussein, it still remained a challenge for the victorious power to assert its will on Iraq.
In Baghdad, which has seen a series of powerful US ambassadors -- men the international press often like to refer to
as American viceroys -- it is now up to Vice President Joe Biden to make repeated visits to allied Iraqi politicians in an
effort to get them to finally establish a respectable democracy. But the embassy cables make it very clear that
Obama's deputy has made little headway.
Instead, the Americans are forced to endure the endless tirades of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek, who claims to
have always known that the Iraq war was the ""biggest mistake ever committed"" and who advised the Americans to
""forget about democracy in Iraq."" Once the US forces depart, Mubarak said, the best way to ensure a peaceful
transition is for there to be a military coup. They are statements that add insult to injury.
On the whole, the cables from the Middle East expose the superpower's weaknesses. Washington has always viewed it
as vital to its survival to secure its share of energy reserves, but the world power is often quickly reduced to becoming
a plaything of diverse interests. And it is drawn into the animosities between Arabs and Israelis, Shiites and Sunnis,
between Islamists and secularists, between despots and kings. Often enough, the lesson of the documents that have
now been obtained, is that the Arab leaders use their friends in Washington to expand their own positions of power.
Editor's note: DER SPIEGEL's full reporting on the WikiLeaks US diplomatic cables will be published first in
the German-language edition of the magazine, which will be available on Monday to subscribers and at
newsstands in Germany and Europe. SPIEGEL ONLINE International will publish extended excerpts of
SPIEGEL's reporting in English in a series that will launch on Monday.

The administration's response seems quite weak to me.
This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic
material of the country. No State department can operate if it can't keep its own classified cables and internal orders
confidential — Ithink this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?
The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.
But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be
treated as putting lives in danger. For what it is worth, I think you need to order a full scale review and upgrading of the
cyber security of the state department immediately. To offer a bounty for the capture of those responsible. And as I see
you doing, take an aggressive position on Wikileaks. Just being seen as apologizing for the content is weak compared to
reacting and acting to shore up the key principles behind security and aggressively dealing with the problem directly.
For what it's worth, that's my view.

Subject: (AP) Iran blocks former president's website
TEHRAN (AP) - The website of former Iranian President Khatami announced authorities have blocked it without
explanation.
A statement on Khatami.ir said a government committee had decided to filter the website, which on November 4
could only be reached from inside Iran through proxy servers.
While the site was not known to be controversial, Khatami, president from 1997 to 2005, supported opposition leader
Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 presidential election that led to re-election of President Ahmadinejad.
Earlier this year authorities banned Khatami from traveling to Japan to attend a conference.

Sokolsky, Richard D; McAuliffe, Marisa S
As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
""off-shore/on-shore balancing"" that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.
Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me
later next week, this would greatly help.
I look forward to further discussion.

Depending of course on how the meeting goes today, we think it would be very good if the Secretary could attend the
VP meeting tomorrow to make sure that the hard questions about where we are on Iraq government formation are
addressed.
The Secretary uniquely brings the ability to express her instincts on where this process is going (or not going) and she
brings the understanding of the whole region that we must take into account as we push for an Iraqi government. Her
understanding of where we are on the Peace Process, our credibility with the full range of Arab leaders, and our
relationship with Iran, are subjects she can put on the table and make sure are comprehensively considered before any
decisions on a way forward are reached.

was approved for Gilo, a Jewish housing development in east Jerusalem. The project still needs final approval from

A Foreign Policy 100 top global thinkers plug for the QDDR
For a tiny bit of good news in such a bleak week, you and President Clinton came in at no. 13 in
Foreign Policy's second annual list of top global thinkers, with special commendation to you for
launching the QDDR (and for cookstoves and women's rights, as well as for your strong position
on American leadership). Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respective
roles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups
13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton
for proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.
FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK
SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:
""After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say
it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.""
Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and
the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.
Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global
Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,
bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic
solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to
rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he
spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.
Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an
accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's
temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the
objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's
poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is
what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.
74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughter
for setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.
POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS, DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTON
Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how the
United States deals with its allies and enemies abroad, and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes fell
largely to two people in particular. At the State Department, Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of policy planning, is
spearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenate
marginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, preparing for a world in
which America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.
Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy, co-founder of the Center for a New
American Security think tank, who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that both
candidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's own
quadrennial review, a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediate
needs posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistan
strategy, albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy,"" she told
the Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.""

Dear Ambassador Kim,
Since I haven't heard from you I assume my trip to North Korea is okay with you guys. My plan is to
leave Monday, December 13th, stay for 2 days and return to the United States on the weekend.
The North Koreans have assured me that they will not exploit my visit and that they have some positive
messages to convey. They know that I am not an envoy of the administration and that is fine with them.
My sense is that they will with draw the invitation if I postpone once again at your request.
Needless to say, the Obama administration wishes will be an important factor to me as I pursue this trip.
All the best — Bill Richardson

Afghanistan Nine U.S. soldiers killed in helicopter crash in Zabul province in south. Taliban claimed
responsibility; investigation is proceeding. On Louis Berger case, Jack insisted we make clear in press that
we're not going to keep pouring money into any operations that are corrupt.
Iran Jim received rapturous ovation at AIPAC yesterday on Administration's Iran policy.
AIP Funding Jack and Pat commented on Secretary's concern that we ensure we maximize available reserves
as FY'10 draws to a close, to help easy tough budget choices. Pat reports he's maximized commitments to
operational funds to the maximum extent possible, and will continue to work this.
PA Funding Jim and Jack noted lagging Saudi response; Jack said he would work with Rich to find way
around ESF cap to explore an additional $50-100M in next few weeks.
Congress DoJ throwing up last-minute objections to UK/Australia Defense Trade Treaties scheduled to be
voted out of SFRC 2:30 p.m. Andrew Shapiro working to fix with DoJ; Jim is standing by to intervene if
necessary. We have hearings scheduled for all but two nominees (Susan Johnson Cook for Religious Freedom
and George Krol for Uzbekistan). House may decide to adjourn this week. Saudi arms sale briefings going
well; AIPAC will likely not oppose if administration boosts funding for Joint Strike Fighter. Menendez still
planning to hold hearing on Megrahi 9/28; Bill Burns now reviewing State decouments we can release. NDAA
cloture vote in Senate today; seems unlikely to succeed because of continuing controversy on DADT. DeMint
appears ready to lift hold on US accession to Child Support Treaty if we issue statement that we don't intend
to support Declaration on Rights of Child.

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a ""capabilities review"" and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The
amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.
As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.
Karen

Subject: CARE Policy Recommendations to Meet the MDGs
Dear Ms. Mills:
CARE is pleased that the international community will come together at the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
Summit from Sept. 20-22, 2010, in New York, to recommit to and accelerate progress toward the achievement of the
MDGs by 2015. We also welcome the United States' Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, ""Celebrate,
Innovate and Sustain: Toward 2015 and Beyond."" While we have made progress on some goals, we still have much to do
if we are going to meet these global commitments by 2015.
Attached or linked below are CARE's recommendations for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and for
strengthening the US' MDG strategy. Our recommendations include approaches and strategies proven to deliver results
specifically on MDGs 1, 3, 5 and 7. CARE's reflections on the MDGs are drawn from more than 60 years of experience
working with the poorest communities in more than 70 countries around the world. Women are at the heart of CARE's
efforts because experience shows that a woman's achievements yield dramatic benefits for her entire family and the larger
community. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment is central to poverty reduction and the achievement
of all MDGs.
The MDG Summit provides a critical opportunity to take bold and decisive action. CARE believes that the following guiding
principles must be reflected in the outcome of the MDG Summit, in the US' MDG strategy, as well as in the US' and the
international community's implementation efforts:
• An emphasis on meeting the needs of people in extreme poverty and the most vulnerable populations;
• Promotion of gender equality, gender responsiveness, and the empowerment of women;
• Adherence to broad-based country ownership, including broad stakeholder engagement with local communities,
women's groups, and other vulnerable populations, in a whole-of-society approach to development;
• Recognition of the linkages among the eight MDGs; and
• A commitment to transparency, mutual accountability, and mechanisms to track results.
Any recommitment to the MDGs must be coupled with commitments to mobilize the necessary resources that will reach
the people who need them most. In the context of the US' development strategy, CARE also believes that USAID must be
empowered as the premier US development agency to lead these efforts, and we call on the Administration and Congress
to work together to reform and modernize US foreign assistance policies, efforts and strategies.
CARE urges bold efforts to recommit to the MDGs and ensure progress toward their achievement. The MDG Summit can
be the turning point in collective efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. It is critical that the global community unite around
a shared action-oriented strategy for meeting — and exceeding — these goals and begin to lay the groundwork for post-
2015.
CARE stands ready to support your efforts and looks forward to continuing valuable collaboration with the US government
and other leaders to tackle poverty worldwide. Please do not hesitate to call on us.

aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her ""new American moment""—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living ""a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential."" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that ""we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad.""
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: ""The United States can, must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that, Clinton promised ""a
new global architecture,"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow ""the rules of the road"" in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like ""American might,"" words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for ""good, old-fashioned diplomacy,"" and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first, of course, is ""economic power."" But it is her
hailing of the second—America's ""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president."" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech.
Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's
apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based,
by contrast, on the unquestionable premise that America is the world's leader.
Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first,
of course, is ""economic power."" But it is her hailing of the second—America's
""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between
the president and the secretary of state is that they both understand who is
president."" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact,
plain to behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the
growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much better president than
Obama.

In his Sunday op-ed, Chris Smith politicized the broadly-accepted Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Contrary to Smith's assertions, access to legal abortion will not be on the agenda of the MDG Summit this week in New
York. The key UN document on this issue makes clear that nations have the right to set their own abortion laws. Instead,
world leaders will focus on how to rid the world of extreme poverty and hunger and to make dramatic improvement to the
health of women and children around the globe.
Ensuring access to health services, including modern family planning, can play a critically important role in saving the
lives of women. In fact, it can reduce 40% of maternal deaths worldwide. More than two hundred million women in the
developing world want access to family planning, but can't get it. This has a dramatic impact, increasing deaths during
childbirth, leaving millions of newborns behind.
Listening to the voices of women in the developing world, not injecting American domestic politics into the MDG Summit,
is the surest way to promote the goals on which we can all agree.

Subject: (Haaretz) Peres to Abbas: Netanyahu is a trustworthy partner
Palestinian president calls Israeli counterpart to offer Rosh Hashanah greetings; Peres urges Abbas not to abandon
peace talks.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called President Shimon Peres to offer greetings for the Jewish holiday of Rosh
Hashanah. During the telephone conversation, Peres pleaded with Abbas to ""trust [Prime Minister Benjamin]
Netanyahu.""
Against the backdrop of recently relaunched direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Peres urged
the Palestinian president ""not to abandon the talks before peace is achieved. There is no one more suited than you to
achieve peace for your people, and for the entire region.""
Abbas and other senior Palestinian negotiators have threatened to quit the U.S.-backed negotiations if Israel should
resume construction in West Bank settlements. Last November, Netanyahu declared a 10-month moratorium on
construction in settlements, but the freeze is set to expire at the end of this month, and it is not yet clear whether it will
be renewed.
""Even if things don't appear perfect,"" Peres told Abbas, ""the path toward peace and an independent Palestinian state is
certainly preferable to an ongoing conflict and bloodshed. Even if there will be crises and disagreements, and the road
will seem imperfect, I'm sure that new and creative solutions can be achieved.""
Abbas replied that ""we're serious and our goal is to achieve a peace agreement as soon as possible."" To this Peres
responded saying ""I'm sure Netanyahu is a trustworthy partner.""
Earlier, Abbas spoke with Netanyahu by phone. The two leaders offered mutual greetings for the holidays, the Muslim
Eid el Fitr and Jewish Rosh Hashanah.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A planned Israeli-Palestinian summit due to be held in Paris by the end of the month has been
rescheduled, the Israeli prime minister's office said on October 16, a sign of increased strain over stalled peace
talks. French President Sarkozy invited Prime Minister Netanyahu, Palestinian President Abbas and Egyptian President
Mubarak to meet before the end of October, although an exact date for the summit had not been set. ""Following joint
consultations it has been agreed to set a new date for the preparatory meeting,"" a statement from Netanyahu's office
said, adding there was no chance of holding it on Oct 21, which was previously thought to be possible. ""We are looking
for a new date that works for everybody, although there is nothing firm scheduled yet,"" an Israeli government official
told Reuters.

Re: Some paragraphs on the Tea Party
First, of course your instinct is right to attempt to save the situation. I think, however, it is
fraught. Being right easily might be worse than being wrong. (Doing absolutely nothing,
meanwhile, would bear no cost, just to note the benefits of irresponsibility.) So, how any advice
can be proposed without potential pitfalls is a mystery to me. It may be that Bill delivers the
message in public, on the stump. This message, on extremism and the GOP, ought to be given
soon, on Labor Day or immediately thereafter. Urgently, the momentum of the far right needs to
be blunted; it must be redefined; the political discussion must be shaped and shifted; and the
GOP must be put on the defensive and begin to pay the price.
I will send you another memo soon, with other messages, themes and strategies.
Here, for better or worse, is some language on extremism and the Republican Party:
The Republican Party today is a captive party. It is captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme
right. It is captive to its out-of-power desperation for political power—willing to do and say
anything to grab it--willing to use extremists to help climb back to power—willing to give the
extremists power. No one is speaking up for responsible conservatism within the Republican
Party. Who will play the role of William F. Buckley, Jr.? Or Richard Nixon? Or Ronald Reagan?
Or Barry Goldwater? They all drew lines to separate the party from the extremists. Now who has
the courage to condemn the outrageous bigotry and slander against the President? Have they at
long last no sense of decency?
If the Republicans don't have the nerve to speak up for their own best heritage, then someone has
to do it. The Republican Party is in a state of political disorder. Into the midst of its chaos a
Trojan Horse has been thrust in the form of a self-proclaimed Tea Party as though the extremists
behind it have something to do with the American Revolution and are not a stealth takeover
operation of a confused political party funded by the same people who paid for the extremist
movements against President Eisenhower and President Kennedy.

There is a straight line between extremists then and extremists now. One of those lines is a
money line. Follow the money. Another continuity is the far right John Birch Society that is
praised today by Glenn Beck. Listen closely. Yet another of those lines are the same accusations
of disloyalty. Ike was a Communist. John F. Kennedy was a Communist. They said President
Nixon was a tool of international Communism. And when the Cold War was ending they said
Ronald Reagan was ""a useful idiot of the Kremlin."" Now they are saying that President Obama is
a socialist and at the same time a fascist. They say he's a racist and a secret Muslim. They claim
the President of the United States is not an American. It's so crazy it sounds like a science fiction
novel, but we've heard it all before. The extremists have not changed. From Ike to JFK, from
Nixon to Reagan, and now Obama, it's the same old horsestuff.
For anyone with common sense it might seem like one big joke, a big put-on, or maybe just a big
con job. But it's dangerous. It's toxic. Why? In the name of the founding fathers, the
Constitution and the flag, in the name of taking back our country and restoring it, they would
transform our democracy into something we wouldn't recognize. The extremists of the far right
want to replace the greatest experiment in constitutional democracy with their own far-out
ideology—trashing everything from religious liberty to protections from a dog-eat-dog boom and
bust economy. Public education, a safe environment, national highways, safe transportation,
Social Security, Medicare, health care for all, even the Federal Reserve created to curb economic
chaos—they want to get rid of all of it. If you think that if they had their way they wouldn't kick
the country into an economic abyss, produce another Great Depression, then I've got a reality
show in Alaska for you. And that's not all that's in their sweeping blueprint for power.
The Republican Party is being purged of moderates, responsible conservatives, anyone who has a
thought they don't like. If s divide and conquer. Divide.the Republican Party. Divide the nation.
Region against region, South against North, West against East. rural America against cities, state
governments against the federal government, religion against religion, and soon. before you
know it, it won't look or feel like America. Out of loud declarations of love of country, they will
break this country apart.
How far do the extremists want to go? The demonizing of enemies and even religions is a means
to an end. That end is political power. Political power for themselves, for their political leaders—
characters who are hardly outsiders but dusty denizens roaming the corridors of power for
decades. They want political power—political power for favors, exemptions and loopholes for
the Daddy Warbucks and Scrooge McDucks funding them. Political power for special interests.
Political power against the national interest. Political power against the common good. Political
power against the good society.
President Obama is their target because the people have put him in his office and he stands in the
way of the extremists. They are against him precisely because he's making progress. And
progress is not what they want. They want power for themselves. So they will say anything to
tear down the President. But they are at war with more than President Obama. They are at war
with President Andrew Jackson. That's how far back they want to go. They want to go back the
1830s. They want to go back to before the Civil War; ""lips dripping with the words of
interposition and nullification,"" to quote Martin Luther King, Jr. in his famous ""I have a dream""

democratic government—and nullify the law of the land in the name of their strange doctrines.
So when I say that this is dangerous and toxic, we've been there before. Fanatics have divided
America in the past. We know, as another president said, ""A house divided against itself cannot
stand.""
And when you see them demonizing the President, Ike, JFK, Obama, take your pick—when you
see them accusing members of the Republican Party of treason—when you hear them compare
the American experiment in democracy to Hitler's Nazi state or Stalin's Communist
totalitarianism—when you hear them talk of ""liberty"" and they mean taking away Social
Security from people who worked their whole lives to earn it—when you hear them talk of
""freedom"" when they want to bring back good old fashioned discrimination—when you hear
them talk of ""the Constitution"" when they want to get rid of the letter and spirit of the
government designed by the framers of the Constitution—when you hear them talk of
""democracy"" when they want to get rid of direct election of senators—when you hear them talk
about ""restoration"" when they want to gut public education and Medicare and basic economic
and environmental protections—trashing the work and progress of generations—then you know
that behind the patriotic words lies a truly radical agenda.
It was Dwight Eisenhower who warned: ""Should any political party attempt to abolish Social
Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not
hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that
believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his
background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man
from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.""
It was John F. Kennedy who said: ""In the most critical periods of our nation's history, there have
always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by
finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat. Financial crises could
be explained by the presence of too many immigrants or too few greenbacks... So let us not heed
these counsels of fear and suspicion... Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of
confidence rather than crusades of suspicion. Let us prove we think our country great by striving
to make it greater.""
Outspoken conservatives like William F. Buckley drew the line and stood up for principle
against the extremists, calling them ""idiotic"" and ""paranoid."" Barry Goldwater, at the end of his
life, said, ""Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt
the Republican Party much more than the Democrats have.""
Then, this sort of thing, instilling a tone of confidence: Come together, right now...for a new era
of progress...rebuilding America... the work of a new generation...building on the progress of
generations...facing any challenge...resolving that we can and will overcome any
obstacle...keeping the faith, not succumbing to temptations of fear and suspicion...not retreating
but advancing...not dividing the American people for short-term politics but bringing the
American people together for long-term progress...combining our will, our work, our
intelligence, creativity, enterprise, and energy to make a new world of freedom for ourselves and
our children...

GAME CHANGE: 2012 OFF TO SLOW START – GOP heavyweights hold back, freezing field
compared to past cycles -- Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith: ""[T]he primary is on track to start later, and
more cautiously, than it has in the recent past. In the fall of 2006, Mitt Romney and John McCain were openly
battling over endorsements from Republican operatives, donors and even county sheriffs in the early primary
states. The two men beat a well-worn path to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and especially Iowa, where they
had to watch their step to avoid tripping over Democratic hopefuls like John Edwards and Evan Bayh. But at the
same point four years later, as the 2010 election enters the home stretch, top-tier Republican presidential
contenders are hesitant to set foot in the states that kick off the presidential campaign process, let alone issue
press releases touting their latest gets there.
--""[Thell GOP nominating contest is shaping up ... as a game of chicken ... Romney, Sarah Palin, Haley
Barbour, Mitch Daniels and a few other ambitious figures are largely eyeing each other while publicly holding
back, leaving Tim Pawlenty as the only mainstream Republican trudging down the traditional, early path ...
Together, they're all making a mockery of the conventional wisdom about the longer and longer arcs that
modern White House campaigns demand. ... There are three main reasons for the delay: The intense focus on
the 2010 midterms; the risks of starting too early; and, especially for the best-prepared candidate, Romney, a
paralyzing fear of failure in Iowa. In a sense, the incentives this year are reversed: candidates have better
reasons to publicly hold off on declaring their candidacy than to try to gain an early foothold.""

STORY DU JOUR – N.Y. Times Al, 1 col. at the fold, ""G.O.P. Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists,"" by
Eric Lipton: ""Mr. Boehner ... maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides
representing some of the nation's biggest businesses ... They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars
to his campaigns, provided him with rides on their corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and
waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is
soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed. Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge
routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as often as several times a week.""

--A BOEHNER AIDE: ""Boehner's positions on the issues he cited are longstanding, and are obviously not the
result of one lobbyist's influence. The fact that any reporter would believe or write that Boehner's opposition to

executives, the debit card fee cap, and increased fees on oil and gas companies. 'Yes, that is correct,' Steel
responded to Lipton, adding 'I can tell you why, if you care.' Steel says he received no further notes from
Lipton. Steel says Boehner has long held those positions and does not hold them as a result of lobbying. Hours

'won' Boehner's backing was changed to one in which a lobbyist 'sought' Boehner's backing. That's a rather

Kabul: ""Large parts of the country that were once completely safe, like most of the northern provinces, now
have a substantial Taliban presence ... The worsening security comes as the Obama administration is under
increasing pressure to show results to maintain public support for the war, and raises serious concerns about
whether the country can hold legitimate nationwide elections for Parliament next Saturday. Unarmed
government employees can no longer travel safely in 30 percent of the country's 368 districts, according to
published United Nations estimates ... The number of insurgent attacks has increased significantly ... American
military officials say the increased level of violence is related to the rise in the number of its forces here. The
last 2,000 of 30,000 new American troops are expected to arrive in the next week or two, military officials say.
The result is more military operations, they say, and more opportunities for the insurgents to attack coalition

officials who once supported the war are now questioning it's worth the cost"": ""The doubters include
Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, the closest thing the United States has to an
official 'foreign policy establishment'; Leslie H. Gelb, his predecessor; and Robert D. Blackwill, a former aide
to President George W. Bush. 'The current strategy isn't working, and it's costing roughly $100 billion a year,'
Haass, a former aide to then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, told me last week. 'It's time for a major
recalibration: not an immediate withdrawal but a significant scaling down of our ambitions.' And last week, a
group of 46 foreign policy experts issued a joint report arguing that the goal of building a unified, stable
Afghanistan is beyond the ability of the United States, and unnecessary to boot. The panel, the Afghanistan
Study Group, included both longtime critics of the war and some who supported U.S. policy until recently. ...
They cite three main reasons for their escalating pessimism. The first: setbacks (including a major offensive in
Kandahar that was scheduled to be in full swing by now but is only getting underway). Next: Afghan President
Hamid Karzai's failure to support a U.S.-sponsored anti-corruption campaign. And finally, there's that $100-
billion annual price tag. ... [A]s Obama approaches a December review of his strategy in Afghanistan, the
debate is noticeably opening up, driven in part by the weight of that $100-billion cost."" http://lat.ms/9XfIcyC

streaming out of the Senate office buildings towards us. All of the cabs lined up waiting for fares had their
radios on and their windows open. I heard the buildings collapse that way. I connected with my wife who was in

trying to assess situation in seven schools around ground zero and how to get 1.1 million kids home safely,
knowing that in some cases their parent might not be coming home. Quite a shocker to step out of the subway in

TOP TALKERS:
MAUREEN DOWD, ""When Peggy Left Barry: Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose"": ""One of the
independent voters Obama will be trying to charm over the next two years is my sister, Peggy, a formerly ardent
Obamican (a Republican who changed spots to vote for Obama). ... Despite being a Washington native, Peggy
believed that the dazzling young newcomer could change Washington. But she has lost a lot of faith now,
saying she might vote for Mitt Romney over Obama if Romney is the Republican nominee in 2012. (Sarah
Palin shouldn't count on her vote though. In Peggy's words, 'Are you nuts?') Peggy thinks the president has
done fine managing W.'s messes in Iraq and Afghanistan. And she lights up at the mention of his vice president,
Joe Biden. But she thinks Obama has to get 'a backbone' if he wants to lure her back to the fold. ... While
Obama's out in the country trying to save Congressional Democrats, he should also think about how he's going
to save himself. http://nyti.ms/92Dudr
FRANK RICH, ""Time for This Big Dog to Bite Back: The Democrats' obituaries may yet prove
premature."": ""On Labor Day, the fighting Obama abruptly re-emerged, a far cry from the man whose Oval
Office address on Iraq days earlier was about as persuasive as a hostage video. ... For a guy facing a tidal wave,
the president was so ebullient, you had to wonder if he knew something we didn't. Maybe he simply read the
unabridged poll numbers ... Those numbers are hardly as monochromatic as advertised. Obama's approval
rating, for months a consistent (not imploding) 45-ish percent, still makes him arguably America's most popular
national politician. The polls also continue to show that, while both political parties are despised, Democrats are
slightly less despised than Republicans. ... In a second forceful speech last week, delivered outside Cleveland,
Obama titillated the political press by calling out Boehner by name eight times. But though Boehner is a nice
soft target ... he's merely a front-man. Obama must also call out the powerful interests who are pulling the
G.O.P.'s strings (and filling its coffers), whether on Wall Street or in Big Oil or any other sector where special
interests are aligned against reform in the public interest. If Obama can speak lucidly about a subject as thorny
as race, he can surely do a far more specific job of telling the story of how we got to this economic impasse.""

MEDIA WATCH – ""Bret Baier is the new face of Election Night coverage at Fox News: 40-year-old
reporter part of a new generation of political news anchors,"" by Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik: ""Baier
steps up this fall as lead political news anchor on Election Night replacing Brit Hume, who moved after the
2008 elections to the role of senior political analyst. Given the way Fox News has come to lead in ratings for
coverage of political events since CNN's glory days during the presidential campaign of 2008, Baier's ascension
makes for a significant changing of the guard in broadcast journalism. The seat he now occupies in Fox's
Washington studios is one of the most influential in American political life — a fact not lost on the boyish-
looking anchorman who turned 40 on Aug. 4, which also is President Barack Obama's birthday. ... He has been
invited for the first time in his career to moderate a televised debate — a role more often reserved for the likes
of Jim Lehrer or Bob Schieffer of public and network TV. This one will be held Oct. 4 in Hartford, Conn., in a
hotly contested race between Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Linda McMahon for a U.S. Senate
seat. ...
""As for his hour of news from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. weeknights ['Special Report], Baier almost doubles the
combined audience of his competitors on CNN and MSNBC. So far this year, 'Special Report' has an
average nightly audience of 2,107,000 in viewers — compared with 604,000 for 'The Ed Show' on MSNBC
and 545,000 for Wolf Blitzer's 'Situation Room' on CNN. ... Michael Clemente, senior vice president at Fox
News, says the foundation laid down by Hume has played a crucial role in Baler's success. 'Brit Hume had the
legacy with the audience — a legacy that went back to his days with ABC News,' Clemente says. `So why has
it worked with Bret? First of all, the transition was handled well; Bret filled in quite a bit as Brit was winding
down. But people make a judgment pretty quickly, and I think they judged Bret as being an honest, fair and
smart reporter. And it wasn't like pulling some guy out of thin air who had just been a news reader on some
local station.' ... [Baier:] 'You know the Fox Atlanta bureau that I joined in 1998 — that started in my
apartment in Atlanta with a fax machine and a cell phone. That was the bureau. And I still have that sense of us
being that startup that is still trying to make it all come together."" http://bit.ly/apgxA2
SPORTS BLINK – COLLEGE FOOTBALL – AP: ""Ohio State and Oklahoma won their BCS
championship game rematches and showed that a couple of former powerhouses from the Sunshine State are
not quite ready to return to elite status. Behind the running of Terrelle Pryor and a ball-hawking defense, the
second-ranked Buckeyes beat No. 12 Miami 36-24 on Saturday at the Horseshoe in Columbus. ... In Norman,
Okla., Landry Jones bounced back from a sluggish opener and led the 10th-ranked Sooners to an easy 47-17
victory over No. 17 Florida State.""
--""USC hangs on for a 17-14 victory over Virginia,"" by L.A. Times' Gary Klein: ""USC's defense is not as
bad as it looked in the opener, the offense not nearly as good. Those were the immediate impressions Trojans
fans came away with Saturday night at the Coliseum after the 16th-ranked Trojans' 17-14 victory over Virginia.
The undisciplined style that resulted in multiple costly penalties? That remained consistent as the Trojans
improved to 2-0 under first-year Coach Lane Kiffin. Quarterback Matt Barkley passed for two touchdowns late
in the first half and, though the defense gave up a last-minute touchdown, the Trojans earned a harder-than-
expected victory over the Cavaliers, a near three-touchdown underdog playing their first game in California.
'I'm extremely disappointed with our performance,' Kiffin said. 'That's the most miserable 2-0 locker room I've
ever been in, which is good. I think our players understand."" http://lat.ms/99w6au

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will push for legislation to require those wanting to become
Israeli citizens to pledge loyalty to the ""nation-state of the Jewish people."" Under Israeli law, Jews wanting to immigrate
to Israel are granted automatic citizenship and non-Jews have to take a loyalty oath to the ""state of Israel"".
The amendment would win favor with one of Netanyahu's key coalition partners, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman,
who leads the right-wing Israel our Home party. Lieberman has advocated a loyalty oath to the Jewish state for all
Israelis, including Arab citizens who make up some 20 percent of the population.

Subject: Chas Freeman's Speech in Oslo -- YOU SHOULD READ
Fmr. Amb. Chas Freeman, whom I know is on the outs w/ us but who nevertheless merits the respect of many of the
smartest foreign policy analysts I know, gave the attached speech to the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in
Oslo on Sept 1, the day before you held the opening peace talks in DC. His speech has been widely circulated on the
Internet since then, so you should at least skim it for that reason alone. It is long, and there are parts of it you will
strongly disagree with, but I would still recommend reading it, above all now. But given your time constraints, in the
attached document I have excerpted the parts I think are most valuable for us and added a few comments of my own
and then included the speech as a whole. In particular, given your interest in Palestinian/Arab psychology and where I
think you personally can make a mark that has eluded others, I would point you to the three excerpted graphs below.
""Arabic has two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in
either English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle
that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat - relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The
West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel
responded with intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker
over the terms on which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I [this is Freeman talking] cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a
point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how
that partner understands things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded
to want. One of the reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much
effort to understand how others reason and how they rank their interests.""

EXCERPTS FROM CHAS FREEMAN SPEECH WITH SOME NOTES
FROM AMS (SPEECH IN ITS ENTIRELY FOLLOWS)
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it
by violence. It is almost impossible to impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be
sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality directs our
attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to
remedy the problems these absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the
Palestinian people to represent them - Hamas - is not there. Yet there can be no
peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel.
(Both these agreements were explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to
accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.)

Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation.
A failure to reconcile either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would
doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be represented in Washington
only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative,
Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple
and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest installment of
the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the
American electorate and also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian
delegation. At another level, they result from the way the United States has
defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and
views this definition evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political
culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new
""peace process"" have officially acknowledged or responded to the Arab peace
initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state,
should Israel make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the
Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer, ignore its precondition that Israelis
come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist""
the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offends Arabs on many levels. In
framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for
something well beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish
state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem to be insisting on
Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that
state was established, and the manner in which it has comported itself. Must
Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and accept
peace?
Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that
European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a homeland for
traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the
forcible eviction of Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this
end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking them to affirm
that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see
the demand that they recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever
attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral expansion at Palestinian
expense.

The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a
longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns about Israel as a form
of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing
Arab views, U.S. peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab
acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of acceptance can
help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take
risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has
been trotted out, it has been met with incredulity. To most in the region, it
encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised
appeal for a policy of appeasement of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to
construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of carrots
so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political
pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously unpersuasive. It has failed so many times
that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of George
Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced
as part of the proposed follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in
Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other Arabs could not be
persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a
quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic has two quite different
words that are both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that
doesn't exist in either English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to
the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in bazaars between
strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no
obligation not to scam each other. Another, ""rnufaawadhat,"" describes the
dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that
3

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015
take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who
seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of
statesmanship to initiate a process of mufaawadhat - relationship-building
between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act.
After a while, Israel responded with intermittent, somewhat oblique
suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the
terms on which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as
insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of
thought, but to make a point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a
negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that
partner understands things and help him to see a way forward that will bring
him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the reasons we can't
seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make
much effort to understand how others reason and how they rank their interests.
In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are long on empathy and
expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The
essential militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We
have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have forgotten how to listen to them or
persuade them.
*********
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the
Holy Land and their implications for what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that
Americans and Norwegians, indeed Europeans in general, share common interests
that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include - but are, of
course, not limited to - gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of
Israel; eliminating the gross injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism
against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as friendly Arab regimes;
and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely,
a revival of anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of
these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to the Israeli occupation and freedom
for Palestinians.

Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from
occupation as well as self-determination for Palestinians. They may not be concerned
to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest in ending
the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism,
and eliminating the tensions with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels.
These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as they very clearly
did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has
made inter-faith dialogue and the promotion of religious tolerance a main
focus of his domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage -
Mecca and Medina - Saudi Arabia has long transcended its own notorious
religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to
Muslims of all sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic
piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of religious pilgrimage to
Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were
careful to ensure freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic
faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest that Jews, Christians, and
Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab
interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is generally recognized.
This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred
reflects pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American
diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting may well demonstrate that, the election
of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the
achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American
interest as well as everyone else's that others become the path-breakers, enlisting the
United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not expecting
America to overcome its incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in
• the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was happy to organize the public relations for
5

the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only
a peace process that is protected from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics
can succeed.
This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to
realize the objectives both share with most Americans: establishing
internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the
Palestinians, and ending the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it
that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to present today.
I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to
cooperate with the Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving
could lead to the development of still more options for joint or parallel action on
behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the
least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-
promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted than most at public diplomacy. Political
factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some - mostly dismissive - commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left
most Israelis ignorant of its contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space
in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab League declaration and
consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members
of the Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It
might facilitate other sorts of cooperation with them in which European capabilities
can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab Muslims
should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for
Europe's relations with both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-
sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a well-targeted
advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace
with Israel unless there are officials who are empowered by the Palestinian people to
negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so as to
consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to
create a Palestinian peace partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other
factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has acted to preclude
this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at
restoring a unity government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015
The Obama Administration would be under strong domestic political pressure to join
Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.
Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is
charged with enforcing the rule of law internationally. In the case of the Middle East,
however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system has served to
erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty
American vetoes have prevented the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of
the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights conventions, and
relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish
state has silenced the collective voice of the international community as Israel has
illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied territory, administered
collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders,
massacred civilians, barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council
resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior, usually with only the
flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.

America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?
Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East,
with an emphasis on the prospects for peace in the Holy Land. You have further
suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia,
to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at
this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the
last direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential,
positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called ""peace process."" And
if that one step forward in Oslo in 1993 was followed by several steps backwards,
there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing
conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs the world's conscience as well as its
tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians
they dispossessed became, by degrees, the principal source of radicalization and
instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It stimulated
escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of
the Cold War, the interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has
emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is increasingly difficult to distinguish
this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to
play the key international part in this contest. American policies, more than those of
any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in the Middle
East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies
and actions in the Middle East thus affect much more than that region.

Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather
than substance. It has failed to involve parties who are essential to peace. It has acted
on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional support for
peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress.
Its concept of a ""peace process"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli
expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are alternatives to tomorrow's
diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role
for powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.
Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the
door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadat had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush
administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian leaders, setting
the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to
rally other governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but
American power remains far greater than that of any other nation. Nowhere is this
more evident than in the Middle East.
For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United
States to dominate its region militarily and to sustain its economic prosperity. It has
counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of international
law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions.
Unquestioning American support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more
land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the Palestinians or other
Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad
have brought successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority
they assign to land over peace.
Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with
America. This has locked them into a political framework over which Israel exercises
decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic
cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been
able to prevent their progressive confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the
West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.
Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the
management of the search for peace in Palestine remains unchallenged. Since the end
of the Cold War, Russia - once a contender for countervailing influence in the region -
has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union,
having earlier laid the basis for conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands
while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China, India, and other
Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region

itself, Iran has postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to
advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.
On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have
backed their verbal opposition to Israel with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled
into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.
subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic
concessions if it were to conclude arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the
Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt of the
Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most
part, Arab leaders have timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine
problem for them, while obsequiously courting American protection against Israel,
each other, Iran, and - in some cases - their own increasingly frustrated and angry
subjects and citizens.
Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice.
It demands that they embody righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs
at their governing elites' failure to meet these standards generates sympathy for
terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab
governments associated with it.
The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United
States saw it in part as reprisal for American complicity in Israeli cruelties to
Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's
protection of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to
Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attack included suspending its efforts
to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and
Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks
on America and its allies. The armed struggle between Americans and Muslim
radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other countries.
Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war
with America. They are echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the
United States,
The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has
inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a metastasis of terrorism. It has
caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States
as a menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal
security. American populists and European xenophobes have meanwhile undercut
liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers terrorism
by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The

current outburst of bigoted demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural
center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent illustration of this. It
suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is
contagious. It rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are
essential to encompass their political defeat.
President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous
personal disappointment to him. He came into office committed to crafting a new
relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the
international media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and
privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish parliament with persuasive empathy. He
traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably eloquent
message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood
the centrality of injustices in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West.
He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious recrafting of strategy
in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led
to policy change anyone can detect, let alone believe in.
It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and
achievement in the Obama Administration's stewardship of so many aspects of my
country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two
months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land,
Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is only part of what they will consider as they do
so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in the
situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle
East will no longer do this.
Let me begin with the ""peace process,"" a hardy perennial of America's
diplomatic repertoire that the Obama Administration will put back on public display
tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and ""even-handed""
American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and
influence in the Middle East. It provided political cover for conservative Arab
governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to stand with
America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American
relations with Israel and the Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized
domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there hasn't been an
American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the
conceit of a ""peace process"" became an essential political convenience for all
concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peace process"" had expired. It
therefore lived on in phantom form.

Even when there was no ""peace process,"" the possibility of resurrecting one
provided hope to the gullible, cover to the guileful, beguilement for the press, an
excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and - last but far from
least - lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing
of peace without the requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by
Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like magicians, riveting foreign attention
on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their
homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied
territories, and annexed a widening swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs
only to Israel.
Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate
in the search for a ""peace process."" It's not just that there has been no obviously
better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charades justifies
the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status
in the occupied territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level
visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American leaders, engagement in some
sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and
Islamic worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls
show that most American Jews are impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to
the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the government of Israel to
trade land for it.
Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice,
however, these diplomatic distractions have served to obscure Israeli actions and
evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving it.
Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this
history, it has taken a year and a half of relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George
Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as they first
did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic
show in Washington tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are
many reasons to doubt that they will.
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios
who staged all the previously failed ""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one
with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-prepared meeting, at
Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat,
their political authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are
showing up this time to minimize President Obama's political embarrassment in
advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda - still less
to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with
12
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015
this latest - and possibly final - iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process""
are more fundamental.
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab
state west of the Jordan River and stipulates that: ""The Palestinians can run their lives
freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign state.""
This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war
for land in Palestine. It has no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might
thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound by the applicable UN
resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the ""Roadmap,"" or the premise of the
""two-state solution.""
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of
the Israeli occupation can provide. But the authority of Palestinian negotiators to
negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their
standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the
ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its authority to govern was repudiated by voters in
the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power by
grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the
government empowered by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's
constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over a parliament
whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for
whom he, his faction, or his administration can now speak.
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the uninterested going
through the motions of negotiating with the mandate-less. The parties to these talks
seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international credibility. The
United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of
others - the EU, Russia, and the UN - to be able to convene this discussion. It will be
held under the auspices of an American president who was publicly humiliated by
Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute -
Israel's continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air.
But the ""peace process"" has always sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer
ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year was made
at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination
have preceded or resulted from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with
the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will recall the five-year
deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete
results only if the international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-

year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian state. Even then there will be
no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it
by violence. It is almost impossible to impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be
sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality directs our
attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to
remedy the problems these absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the
Palestinian people to represent them - Hamas - is not there. Yet there can be no
peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel.
(Both these agreements were explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to
accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.)
Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation.
A failure to reconcile either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would
doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be represented in Washington
only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative,
Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple
and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest installment of
the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the
American electorate and also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian
delegation. At another level, they result from the way the United States has defined
the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this
definition evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and
negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace
process"" have officially acknowledged or responded to the Arab peace initiative of
2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have
seemed to pocket the Arab offer, ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms
with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the
central purpose of the ""peace process"" offends Arabs on many levels. In framing the
issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East.

To the Arabs, Americans now seem to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea
of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and the manner in
which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can
cease expansion and accept peace?
Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European
anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a homeland for traumatized European
Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of Palestinian
Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously
off-putting. So is asking them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and
is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they recognize a Jewish state with
no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral
expansion at Palestinian expense.
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding
American habit of treating Arab concerns about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and
tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S. peace
processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel.
They argue that gestures of acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-
inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has-
been trotted out, it has been met with incredulity. To most in the region, it
encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised
appeal for a policy of appeasement of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to
construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of carrots
so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political
pusillanimity vis-à-vis Israel is ludicrously unpersuasive. It has failed so many times
that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of George
Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced
as part of the proposed follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in
Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other Arabs could not be
persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick
comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic has two quite different words that are
both translated as ""negotiation,"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in either
English or Hebrew. One word, ""musaawama,"" refers to the no-holds-barred
15

bargaining process that takes place in bazaars between strangers who may never see
each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each other.
Another, ""mufaawadhat,"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of
honor and high principle that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality
between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of
statesmanship to initiate a process of mufaawadhat - relationship-building between
leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It called for a
response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while,
Israel responded with intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to
haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on which a grand gesture has
been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of
thought, but to make a point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a negotiating
partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been
persuaded to want. One of the reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in
the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand how others reason
and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we
Americans are long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on
these for the various Arab parties. The essential militarism of U.S. policies in the
Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We
have forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.
I am not myself an ""Arabist,"" but I am old enough to remember when there
were more than a few such people in the American diplomatic service. These were
officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and empathy
with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own
interest to do things we saw as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are
hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our Middle East
diplomacy.
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake
in the Holy Land and their implications for what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that
Americans and Norwegians, indeed Europeans in general, share common interests
that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include - but are, of
course, not limited to - gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of

Israel; eliminating the gross injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism
against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as friendly Arab regimes;
and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely,
a revival of anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of
these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to the Israeli occupation and freedom
for Palestinians.
Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from
occupation as well as self-determination for Palestinians. They may not be concerned
to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest in ending
the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism,
and eliminating the tensions with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels.
These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as they very clearly
did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made
inter-faith dialogue and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his
domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage - Mecca
and Medina - Saudi Arabia has long transcended its own notorious religious narrow-
mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all sects and
persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence
on the exemption of religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or
manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure freedom of access for
worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city.
It is an interest that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests
affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is generally recognized. This can be the
basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects pathologies
of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination.
Tomorrow's meeting may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama
notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the achievement of peace
between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone
else's that others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they
can in support of what they achieve, but not expecting America to overcome its
incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in
the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was happy to organize the public relations for •
the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only

a peace process that is protected from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics
can succeed.
This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize
the objectives both share with most Americans: establishing internationally recognized
borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending the stimulus to
terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only
four suggestions to present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the
discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the Arabs of the sort that •
Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more
options for joint or parallel action on behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the
least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-
promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted than most at public diplomacy. Political
factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some - mostly dismissive - commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left
most Israelis ignorant of its contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space
in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab League declaration and
consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members
of the Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It
might facilitate other sorts of cooperation with them in which European capabilities
can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab Muslims
should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for
Europe's relations with both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-
sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a well-targeted
advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace
with Israel unless there are officials who are empowered by the Palestinian people to
negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so as to
consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to
create a Palestinian peace partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other
factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has acted to preclude
this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at
restoring a unity government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference.
The Obama Administration would be under strong domestic political pressure to join
Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.

Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is
charged with enforcing the rule of law internationally. In the case of the Middle East,
however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system has served to
erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty
American vetoes have prevented the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of
the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights conventions, and
relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish
state has silenced the collective voice of the international community as Israel has
illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied territory, administered
collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders,
massacred civilians, barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council
resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior, usually with only the
flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.
If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but
illegal, the international community should find a way to say so, even if the UN
Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -
its vision of the rule of law - will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely
exempted from principles, all exempt themselves, and the law of the jungle prevails.
The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both as occupier
and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions.
If the UN General Assembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated
Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink from working in
conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the
Holy Land and beyond need to understand that they are not above the law. If this
message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better chance for peace.
Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States
will frustrate any attempt by the UN Security Council to address the continuing
impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference outside the
UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they
cannot reach agreement in a year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a
follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference would consider
whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond
Israel's 1967 borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de
facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring Israel to grant all governed by it
citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to
strike a deal or to face the consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could
be implemented directly by the states members of the international community.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772410 Date: 08/31/2015
Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to
diplomatic confrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama
Administration itself having proclaimed a one-year deadline in order to entice the
Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken
by Israeli land grabs and settlement activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the
offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel's actions are
delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region
and beyond who are determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all
humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to alleviate. It has become a cancer on
the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage
against injustice that incites terrorism.
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a
basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation between Europeans and Arabs is such a
timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked to set
the stage for a discussion of this issue.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Western efforts to renew peace talks between Syria and Israel are focusing on finding common
ground, but nothing has crystallized yet and the chances of success are unknown, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said.
In his first public assessment of U.S. and French moves to relaunch the talks, Assad told Turkey's TRT television that
envoys from the two countries are trying to accommodate Syria's demands for the return of the Golan Heights and
Israel's security objectives.
Assad said that if the talks were to resume they would be initially indirect, similar to the last four rounds that were
mediated by Turkey and broke off in 2008 without a deal.

Dear Secretary Clinton and Secretary Vilsack:
On behalf of the members of the Food Industry Codex Coalition (FICC)1 we applaud the
Administration's global commitment to food security, through its Feed the Future
initiative, and urge your strong and continuing support for the US government's role in
Codex2 to further this objective. We address this appeal to both of you, as it relates both
to your individual and joint responsibilities on Codex Alimentarius. We are much
encouraged by the Administration's view that ""the private sector is particularly important
for combating food insecurity and increasing the sustainability of our efforts,"" and we
enthusiastically welcome this partnership with the Administration.
We draw your attention especially to the critical relationship between Codex and Feed
the Future. A vibrant science-based global food safety regulatory system which Codex
fosters is among the most tangible and valuable components in the strategy to further our
shared goal to achieve global food security. Safe food is a prerequisite for a sufficient
The FICC represents the interests of over 70 food companies and trade associations keenly interested in
the international standard setting activities of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). FICC
recognizes the critical role Codex serves to facilitate trade and protect consumer health. The coalition,
which represents the entire food chain from production to retail, works to influence international food
policy based on science. FICC members actively engage with U.S. delegates and Codex staff in an effort to
support and strengthen U.S. leadership in Codex.
2 The Codex Alimentarius was created in 1963 under the joint umbrellas of the United Nations' World
Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with a dual mandate:
protection of the health of consumers and the facilitation of fair practices in food trade.

supply. For our developing country partners, Codex standards serve a vital role in
protecting the health of their people, and in facilitating market opportunities for their
agricultural commodities. For the US food and agriculture industry, these science-based
Codex rules help protect our $100 billion agricultural export market by setting global
standards for safe and fair food trade. Moreover, they lay the foundation for achieving
the President's National Export Initiative goal of doubling exports in the next five years.
For all these reasons the US should increase its presence and influence in Codex.
Specifically, we urge your close attention, high priority, and full funding support in these
areas:
• US Codex Office, USDA, and international outreach programs;
• Office of the Codex Chairperson, currently held by an American at USDA;
• Codex-related positions at both FAO and WHO, the two Codex UN oversight
institutions:
• Committed and focused senior policy level participation in the US Codex
Policy Committee;
• High-level participation in US delegations to Codex Commission and
committee meetings;
• Consistent policy positions for Codex meetings; and
• Enhanced collaboration between the US Mission and the Codex Secretariat at
FAO in Rome.
FICC acknowledges with appreciation our government's responsiveness to previous
petitions to the Administration to give strong support to Codex issues, and notes
particularly USDA's earlier action to strengthen the leadership of the US Codex Office.
At this time we respectfully urge your renewed attention to these other critical areas of
Codex activity. Ensuring the full potential of Codex is an essential component to
improve global food safety and achieving America's priority goal of global food
security.
Thank you for your consideration of these views.

Why is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as
a Nazi?
By Joshua Green
An election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the
Republican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German
Waffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.
Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.
lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted
to re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the
Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and
his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his
involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not
subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And
you'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""
Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.
lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively
small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of
Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military
point of view, that's incredible.""
lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian
Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment
video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.
The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to
the ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:
Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to
ensure a ""New and Free Europe"", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -
many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the
protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite
twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men
died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no
matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the
foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.
Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history,"" said Charles
W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,""
which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred."" Sydnor added that re-
enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany
today, you'd be arrested.""
See web-only content:
http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/
Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, ""It is so unhistorical and
so apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who
love putting on uniforms.""
loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as
2003), but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" He says his name and pictures were removed from the
Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years
ago, after his son lost interest.
loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias ""Reinhard Pferdmann,"" which has also been
removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience],"" lott said, ""is the
living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units
what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based
around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,""pferd' is a horse. So it's
literally 'horse man.""
Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he
hoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil
War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.
... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""

lott at Nazi re-enactment.
Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,
disagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and
certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the
Jewish community, but the broader community.""
In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups
but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never, in any of my reenacting of
military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the
tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the
military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" He added that
he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II
American infantryman and paratrooper.
The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death Marches of
Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,"" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers
from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to
American forces in Austria.
""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,"" says
Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. ""The
entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslaved
in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be
exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that
people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""

Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and
his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his
involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not
subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. ""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And
you'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II.""
Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.
lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, ""I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively
small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of
Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military
point of view, that's incredible.""
lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian

Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment
video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.
The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to
the ""twisted"" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:
Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to
ensure a ""New and Free Europe"", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -
many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the
protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite
twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men
died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no
matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the
foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.
Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. ""These guys don't know their history,"" said Charles
W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of ""Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,""
which chronicles an SS division. ""They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred."" Sydnor added that re-
enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. ""If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany
today, you'd be arrested.""

Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, ""It is so unhistorical and
so apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who
love putting on uniforms.""
loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as
2003), but did so with his son ""as a father-son bonding thing."" He says his name and pictures were removed from the
Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years
ago, after his son lost interest.
loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias ""Reinhard Pferdmann,"" which has also been
removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. ""Part of the reenactor's [experience],"" lott said, ""is the
living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units
what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based
around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,""pferd' is a horse. So it's
literally 'horse man.""
Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he
hoped it would not: ""They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil
War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.
... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all.""

lott at Nazi re-enactment.
Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,
disagreed. ""Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and
certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,"" he said. ""I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the
Jewish community, but the broader community.""
In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups
but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: ""Never, in any of my reenacting of
military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772616 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772616 Date: 08/31/2015
tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the
military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life."" He added that
he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II
American infantryman and paratrooper.
The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book ""The Death Marches of
Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,"" Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers
from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to
American forces in Austria.
""What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge,"" says
Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. ""The
entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslaved
in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be
exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that
people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.""

According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John
Boehner will give his ""closing argument"" to the American people on why they should throw out
the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-killing agenda."" He will be returning to his
working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a
man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open
checkbooks and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the
rounds at other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove
and the Republicans believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the
White House made an effort to put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look
like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at
this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was
no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in
the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might
actually brand someone or something first rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would
indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume control over the House (other
than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in
Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a
story, and other than perhaps Sarah PalM, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline
as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every
major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the
Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman,
Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I
conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.orgistatic/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf with 1,000
registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting populations.
The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the
symbol and standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The
results were surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although
as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a ""likely voter"" in this election is as
much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change the
dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well
worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they
would have to hold their noses to vote for Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group
left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both
paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of
those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we
could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in
defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the ""job-killing""
socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring
Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor going in one of the narratives to Karl
Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long
descriptions of ""what's the matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points
against a tough conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by

double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be
speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street executives he convened to try to block Wall Street
reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate
special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political spectrum,
and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that
brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly
more powerful with likely Democratic voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we
need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements
came after the narratives, and likely reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief
online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., ""We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans"" -- a theme
colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the
role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged (e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat
away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't
with the middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years in
Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short
run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this
election in terms of the middle class and small business versus the billionaires and big
corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party
whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and
to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by
supporting the things they say they stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public
interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the
last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were
busy branding them -- and in particular the failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural
consequence of failed Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually
uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the
middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10
million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives
to have a second bite at the apple.

KABUL (Reuters) - The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, has ordered a probe
into the death of a British aid worker killed during a rescue bid by U.S. forces, the U.S. military said. ""Initial reports
indicated the explosion was caused by a detonation triggered by one of the captors who was in close proximity to Linda
Norgrove. Subsequent review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not
conclusively determine the cause of her death,"" it said. The statement comes shortly after British Prime Minister David
Cameron told a news conference Norgrove may have been killed by a grenade from foreign forces during the rescue
operation.

The Political Scene
Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""
Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group
became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.
In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""
Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

The Tea Party's Cold War roots.

ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""

Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group

became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.

In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""

Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>
According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model
John Boehner will give his ""closing argument"" to the American people on why they
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-killing
agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping
manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at
other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and
free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the
president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to
try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most
Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than
playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington
again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when
telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro
Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's
bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>
with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,
although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a ""likely
voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not
just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is
a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those
narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and
others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the
""job-killing"" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with
two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and
we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of ""what's the
matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough
conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who
preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear
whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the
same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special
interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the
political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would
Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more
polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic
voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line
statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for
(although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely
reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter
with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., ""We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans""
-- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum
in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged
(e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the
middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years
in Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and
long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in
November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle
class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are
hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose
primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that
commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give
it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand
for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special
interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging
mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their
opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed
Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested
political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is
split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a. debacle in November and
another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief
political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - European Union-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina will begin only after a new Kosovo
government takes power following elections in February, Kosovo's acting president said. Last month Serbia, which does
not recognize Kosovo's independence, agreed to hold talks with Pristina after it was told its hardline stance on its former
province could halt progress to the EU. In an interview, acting President Jakup Krasniqi said it would be difficult to start
talks during a political crisis that followed President Fatmir Sejdiju's resignation last month. ""The first half of February is
the optimal time to hold early elections,"" he told Reuters. ""The end of March is the period when Kosovo will have its
own institutions and then it can have talks with Serbia."" Krasniqi said he will announce the date of early elections a day
or two after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Pristina. Kosovo had scheduled elections for November 2011,
but Sejdiju's resignation hurt relations between the two main coalition partners: the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)
and Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). Krasniqi said early elections could postpone the sale of Telekom, which is
expected to bring between 300 million - 600 million euros. Whether the government can secure a parliamentary
majority for necessary legislation to sell Telekom is uncertain, he said. ""This is complicated at this point,"" he said.

Subject: names for my swearing in
I would like the people in the cc line to be sent invitations to my swearing in - on the 18th of November. If I have forgotten
someone important please let me know. I am limited to 100 people so this is my A list. MAKE sure you say yes or no to
Andrew because I have another 50 people waiting in line! Thanks. Some I sent invites (like Fanta) just because I love
you - I know you cannot come but I wanted to invite you anyway.
For those of you who will be coming in from out of town, Andrew will ask you for certain information (needed for security
reasons).
Steve - send names of people you want invited with email addresses - I sent Sarah's already but not Diane or John H. or
Bill Livengood or Nickie.
Ambassdor T-Greenfield please forward to Deuce - I do not have his email (I thought I did).
Andrew this list does NOT include the MUST invites like Ambassador Carson, Amb Yamamoto, Undersecretary Patrick
Kennedy and Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (SHE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME). AND of course Administrator Shah.
Patrick and Kris - if Robbie or Fred want to come FINE - send their emails to Andrew but ONLY if they are really coming.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'
More...
• France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma
According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'
Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him
Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him
Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

DEAUVILLE (Reuters) - Russia wants to take part in a NATO-backed missile defense shield and will go to next month's
NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on
October 19.
Security is a major stumbling block in Russia's relationship with the West and has dominated talks between Presidents
Sarkozy and Medvedev and Chancellor Merkel in the northern French seaside town of Deauville.
The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan
for the 28-country alliance on November 19-20 in Lisbon.

You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual
orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular
hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know
that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA
will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work
is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear.

In supporting ratification of the New START Treaty, Democrats are siding with
the cross-party consensus view of virtually the entire foreign policy establishment
— including former President George H.W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Gates,
Secretary of State Clinton, and the secretaries of state from the last five presidents.
In opposing ratification, many Senate Republicans are siding with the position
supported by... Sarah Palin.
The individuals in the first group have over a century of foreign policy
experience between them, and have worked closely on U.S.-Russia relations
for decades. On the other hand, Palin can see Russia from her house.
Apparently, that's good enough for many Senate Republicans.

Names: Radelet from State to USAID
Posted By Josh Rogin Thursday, December 23, 2010 - 12:34 PM Share
Steve Radelet, who joined the State Department last January to be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's top advisor on
development, is moving over to USAID to be their first ever Chief Economist.
Radelet left his post as a senior fellow the Center for Global Development to help Clinton during the development of the
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which was unveiled earlier this month. While at State he co-led the
QDDR task force on aid effectiveness and helped stand up the Feed the Future Initiative, a huge program that will be
transferred to USAID as part of the ODOR implementation. The Chief Economist job at USAID is new.
""The new position of Chief Economist (CE) will help establish USAID as a global leader for innovative policy analysis,
research, and implementation,"" read an internal USAID email about Radelet's move, obtained by The Cable. Radelet will
be part of the senior management team and report director to USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.
According to the email, the job will have four functions:
1. Building USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis, especially macroeconomic analysis, 2. Developing a
network of leading economic researchers and development economists, 3. Cultivating a new generation of economists
and research analysts at the Agency, and 4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in priority
countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Before working at CGD, Radelet was a founding co-chair of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network. He was Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Africa, the Middle East, and Asia from
2000 to 2002.

analysts at the Agency, and
4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in
priority countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Structure:
The Chief Economist will work extensively across the agency with both the functional and regional bureaus.
The CE will report to the Administrator and be a member of the Senior Management Team. The CE will be part of the
Front Office and have a special assistant and administrative support.
The CE will serve in an advisory capacity to the Bureau of Policy Planning and Learning (PPL) and the Bureau for
Sustainable Economic Growth (SEG). Given the cross cutting nature of the CE's work, and the resources and capacity it
will draw upon from both PPL and SEG, the CE will need to work in close alignment with the leadership of these two
Bureaus. The CE will participate in leadership meetings at both PPL and SEG, and be actively involved in advising both
bureaus. The details of this functional relationship will require further discussion between the CE and the Assistant
Administrators for PPL and SEG.
Build USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis
Conduct focused economic and policy analysis in support of Administrator priorities at the direction of the Administrator
and serve as an economics advisor to the Administrator Enhance USAID's abilities to evaluate and understand the cost-
effectiveness and economic impacts of projects and programs.
Working closely with SEG, build USAID's capacity to incorporate rigorous economic analysis into project design,
implementation, and evaluation.
Strengthen USAID's capacity for understanding innovative ideas from external research and analysis and best practices
from other agencies, and incorporating these ideas into USAID programs.
Strengthen the knowledge base of all USAID staff on development economics through seminars, teaching, and training.
Establish regular development economics training seminars and courses for USAID staff and other staff from the
interagency.
Develop a network of researchers and development economists
Build and sustain networks of development economists from both inside and outside of the federal government
Establish and lead an interagency group of development economists and allow for USAID to be seen as a leader for inter-
agency thinking, analysis, and debate on development issues.
Develop strong partnerships between economic units and other major donor organizations such as World Bank, IMF,
DFID, etc.
Develop a ""brain trust"" / advisory board consisting of the world's leading development economists. The ""Brain trust""
would be a mechanism under ACFVA and would leverage outside expertise and analysis in support USAID's economic
growth agenda.
Publish thought pieces for the agency on key priority economic growth issues.
Lead, mentor and guide a network of Agency economists and researchers
Working with SEG and PPL, help cultivate a cadre of senior, mid-career and junior professional policy analysts and
researchers that combine solid analytic and research skills with practical development experience.
Provide structured mentorship, support and guidance for the 77 economists working throughout the Agency.
Mentor and train a new generation of DLI economists.
Provide critical outlet and exchange function for Agency economists with the academic/ intellectual community.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government
spending that Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
•The United States spends nearly as much on military power as every other country in the world
combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend
more than six times as much as the country with the next highest budget, China.
•The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a
legacy of a world war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany,
Russia might invade?
•The intelligence community is so vast that more people have ""top secret"" clearance than live in
Washington, D.C.
•The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year, adjusting for inflation, than we spent
on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the
Spanish-American War combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized
new directions, requested about 6 percent more for the military this year than at the peak of the Bush
administration.

""Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime
in, they'll lose votes,"" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston
University. He is author of a thoughtful recent book, ""Washington Rules: America's Path to
Permanent War.""
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich
knows well. His son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But
the implication is that we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we
have a billionaire military and a pauper diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its
marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is
that military power often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea
or an Iran that is on the nuclear path. Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often
counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they
would enhance American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama
bin Laden into attacking the U.S. In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American
security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our money have been better spent helping
American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against
overinvestment in arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: ""Every
gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from
those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."" And in the Obama
administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that military spending on things
large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has argued
most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there
because they see firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And
here's the trade-off: For the cost of one American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build
about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting
money for armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a
signature project, the quadrennial diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis
on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.

""Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,"" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right.
The review is a great document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House
Republicans are proposing cuts in the State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in
many ways: financing research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime
later, boosting support for community colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of
Americans than a military base in Germany.

JALALABAD (AFP) — A Taliban-style bomb attack killed a district governor in eastern Afghanistan on October 22, police
said. Khorsheed, the governor of Dur Baba in Nangarhar province, was driving to work when the improvised-explosive
device often used in insurgent attacks blew up his vehicle, said police spokesman Colonel Abdul Ghafour. Like many
Afghans, the official had only one name. ""The district governor has been martyred. Three other people, his driver and
guards have been injured,"" Ghafour told AFP. He could not say who was behind the attack, but the tactics were typical

Former president Clinton on mission to rescue Democratic Party in fall
elections
By Philip Rucker
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, October 22, 2010; 12:01 AM
Bill Clinton is baffled. The former president's friends say he is in disbelief that in the closing weeks of the
midterm campaigns Democrats have failed to articulate a coherent message on the economy and, worse, have
allowed themselves to become ""human pinatas.""
So Clinton is deploying himself on a last-ditch, dawn-to-dusk sprint to rescue his beleaguered party. And as the
only president in modern times who has balanced the federal budget, he is leveraging his credibility to become
one of the most fierce defenders of President Obama's economic policies.
""To hear the Republicans tell it, from the second President Obama took his hand off the Bible taking the oath of
office, everything that happened after that was his fault,"" Clinton said this week at a campaign rally for Sen.
Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""I'd like to see any of you get behind a locomotive going straight downhill at 200
miles an hour and stop it in 10 seconds.""
If there was any doubt that Clinton remains the Democratic Party's North Star, it has been erased over the past
few weeks as he has packed legions of supporters into basketball arenas, college quads and airport hangars. He
is the Democrats' most in-demand messenger and, unlike Obama, he is summoned everywhere - no matter how
hostile the territory.
By Election Day, Clinton will have traveled to more than 100 events, including one Thursday in Maryland,
where he appeared with Gov. Martin O'Malley.
Some Democrats are troubled that Clinton, who left office a decade ago, is a bigger draw than Obama and the
party's current leaders. ""Bill Clinton is not going to live forever, and it's time for the Democratic Party to
develop other voices,"" said Bob Rucker, a journalism profressor, as he left a recent Clinton rally at San Jose
State University.

But even with his party out of favor, polls show Clinton is among the most popular national political figures in
the country. His newfound popularity among Republicans is a notable reversal from 16 years ago - when, two
years into his presidency, a GOP resurgence cost Democrats both chambers of Congress.
""Look, folks, I've seen this movie before, in 1994,"" Clinton said at the rally in Everett, Wash. ""I called the
president the other day, and I said: 'Relax. They haven't said anything about you they didn't say about me. The
only reason they're being nice to me right now is because I can't run for anything any more.'""
'Keep on being mad'
Clinton's pitch is rooted in empathy and delivered off the cuff. In Everett, he laid out what he said is the
Republican argument: ""I know you're angry. I know you're scared. . . . So let's make this a referendum on
everything that's bothering you about life right now - take everything that's not working right now and put Patty
Murray's face on it and make it a referendum.""
""It is not a referendum. It. Is. A. Choice,"" he continued, pausing between each word for emphasis, ""a choice
between two different sets of ideas.""
Clinton exhorted the crowd to ""keep on being mad. But concentrate your anger so that it clarifies your judgment
instead of clouding it. . . . The worst thing you can do right now is bring back the shovel brigade to start digging
the hole again.""
No other Democrat has so consistently given voice to the mood of this year's volatile, angsty electorate. Where
other politicians speak of the housing crisis in staid terms - ""Mortgages? I understand homes are underwater,""
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a debate last week - Clinton talks about bad mortgages
as if his family were shackled with one.
""More than 10 million of us are living in houses not worth as much as our mortgages, and we can't move like
we used to do because our credit would be toast for a decade,"" Clinton said at a stop in Espanola, N.M., never
betraying that he is a millionaire many times over and the owner of multiple properties.
Clinton connects with ""how normal 'walking-around' folks are feeling,"" said Paul Begala, a confidant and
former top strategist. ""Both the right and the left have mocked that I-feel-your-pain empathy, but Americans
have always liked it. It's the core of him, even more than the brain. It's real.""
Over the past two weeks, Clinton has had one day off, Saturday, which he spent in Northern California with his
close friend Terry McAuliffe. The two stayed up late, playing cards and drafting new talking points for
Democrats to trot out on the trail.
""He literally sat down with a yellow legal pad,"" said McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, adding that Clinton told him: ""Make sure, Terry, you get these talking points out to every
candidate.""
It was then, McAuliffe said, that Clinton confided that he has been frustrated with the Democrats' message.
""He is just baffled and bewildered about why there has not been a more coherent message talking about what
the party has done, why we allowed ourselves to become human pinatas,"" McAuliffe said. ""I think he is agitated
that Democrats haven't put their best foot forward in explaining to the American public what they've actually
done.""
Student-loan policy

Clinton reserves time near the end of his speeches to talk about student-loan policy change, an Obama
accomplishment he says isn't getting its due on the campaign trail. Clinton bemoans that the United States has
fallen from first to ninth in the world in the percentage of adults with a four-year college degree - because too
many students drop out for fear that they can't repay their loans.
Democrats overhauled student-loan policy to cap monthly repayments at 10 percent of discretionary income - a
law Clinton says Republicans want to repeal.
""Do you know how many working families there are where people go home at night now, men and women and
the children they love better than life, and they're sick with worry, they think they'll never be able to send their
kids to college?"" Clinton said in Everett.
""Oh, yes, you will,"" Clinton continued. ""Do not let this bill be repealed. If the young people of America show
up, we will vote for the future and the bill will be secured. That's why you've got to vote for Patty Murray.
These are real choices here - real, serious choices.""
Clinton, taking time off from running his global charitable foundation, is in the midst of a two-week swing that
has taken him from the Mississippi Delta to the Pacific Northwest and seemingly everywhere in between. It
took him across California, where he put a rivalries aside to join hands with Jerry Brown, running to reclaim his
old job as governor. Aides said Clinton might return to the road next week to visit the battlegrounds of Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
Some assume Democratic leaders in Washington are orchestrating Clinton's campaign activities, but he is
deployed by no one but himself.
Democratic candidates of all stripes are funneling requests and seeking advice through his top aide, Douglas
Band. Clinton prioritizes politicians who helped his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her 2008 presidential
campaign. (As secretary of state, she is banned from political activity.) He also has paid special care to loyal
friends such as Rep. Kendrick B. Meek (D-Fla.), who, despite running a distant third in his Senate race, has
drawn Clinton for more than a half-dozen visits, most recently this week.
The White House and congressional leaders do not coach him on what to say. Clinton does not read from a
prompter and only rarely refers to his notes at the lectern. He gives no interviews with local or national reporters
and on most days races in his motorcade from airport to rally to airport again.
Clinton speaks infrequently with the candidates - in some cases not at all before showing up for an event.
Clinton always has been a voracious consumer of news, especially political news, and aides say he stays up to
speed on their races.
This is evident in his speeches. He devotes a substantial portion to the local issues defining specific races. In
Washington state, he mused repeatedly about a Boeing tanker deal. In New Mexico, he riffed at length about
water use and encroachment from neighboring Texas.
At each stop, Clinton waxes nostalgic, as if he were revisiting an old haunt. At San Jose State: ""In 1992, when I
ran for president the first time, the best rally we had in all of California was here at San Jose State."" In New
Mexico: ""When you voted for me twice, I got to know this state and know its people, and know the unique heart
and soul and dreams, and know the way you accommodate all this diversity and build a common sense of
humanity here. It means something to me. You're special to America.""
After every speech, he flings off his suit jacket and works the crowd. He wraps his arms around folks and listens
for cues about what ails America. Clinton's speeches are bookended by thumping tunes - a Motown classic in
Everett, a Kanye West hit at San Jose State's arena, a mariachi folk song in Espanola.

""I keep thinking I'm too old for this,"" Clinton quipped to a crowd of 5,000 as the sun set behind him over the
open-air Plaza de Espanola at a rally for New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish.
""No! No! No!"" the crowd cried out.
""Then I got out here and started stirring around and realized a lot of people were mad and even more confused,
and I didn't want it on my conscience,"" Clinton said. ""So I sort of loaded up and started strolling around.""

JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians are expressing strong reservations about a U.S. proposal meant to entice Israel to
reinstate limits on West Bank settlement construction and revive peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat did not
reject the proposal outright, but said a decision on whether to endorse it would be made after consultations with
Palestinian and Arab leaders. Erekat says the Palestinians ""have a major problem in not including east Jerusalem.""

Subject: 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria
When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew that Syrian society was growing increasingly young (population
will double in 17 years) and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential
harness for our purposes.
In what is the 1st of what I predict will be many interesting cases in the future, this past week a campaign went viral on
Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their
identities known is notable) for the campaign to remove these teachers, and the Ministry of Education intervened and
fired the teachers.
This is the first known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria.
More will come.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli court found former President Moshe Katsav guilty of rape on December 30,
media reports said, convictions of unprecedented gravity for a head of the Jewish state. Katsav, president from
2000 to 2007, had denied the charges of rape, molestation or harassment lodged by three ex-aides. He may now
try to contest the Tel Aviv District Court's verdict, and what could be a lengthy jail sentence, in the Supreme
Court.

Subject: Brazil's Lula decides against extraditing Italian (Reuters)
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Lula da Silva said he would not extradite former Italian guerrilla
Cesare Battisti, a move that could damage relations with Italy. Brazil's Supreme Court had ruled last year that
Battisti should be extradited on murder convictions from the 1970s in Italy, but it left the final decision to Lula.
The move, announced in a statement released by the Brazilian government, was widely expected and comes a
day after Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi warned that such a decision would be ""incomprehensible and
unacceptable."" Brazilian media reported any decision still had to be verified by the Supreme Court but it was
not immediately clear whether this was just a formality.

BRIDGETOWN (AP) - The Barbados government announced the death of Prime Minister David Thompson at the age of
48.
It says Thompson died early October 23. It was announced last month that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer.
Thompson, who has been prime minister of Barbados since January 2008, first became ill in March and took a leave of
absence from his post in July. Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stuart has been running the government in Thompson's
absence.

Subject: (AP) Fate of Mideast talks in hands of polarizing rabbi
JERUSALEM (AP) - The future of the Mideast peace process could rest in the hands of one very undiplomatic man: an
outspoken 90-year-old rabbi who recently sparked an uproar by saying the Palestinian president should ""perish from the
world."" The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party is expected to hold the swing vote when Cabinet ministers decide on a U.S.
proposal to resume Mideast peace talks. The two Shas ministers participating in the decision are waiting for instructions
from the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. ""All decisions go through the rabbi,"" said Roi Lachmanovitch, a
spokesman for the Shas interior minister. The drama has once again turned the enigmatic rabbi, who has managed to
offend Arabs, secular Jews, Holocaust survivors, women and gays with fiery comments over the years, into the familiar
role of kingmaker. Politicians from outside his party, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are now lobbying for
his support. Officials in Netanyahu's office said his 15-member Security Cabinet - a group of senior government
ministers - remains closely divided, with the outcome of the vote hinging on the two Shas members. Amid the
uncertainty, Israeli officials said a planned vote for November 17 had been put on hold.

Gibbs said he believes an end-of-year session of the Senate will take up the arms control treaty and will be voted on

I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the

(Jerusalem Post) - One policeman was injured in an altercation in Sheikh Jarrah, when police arrived on the scene of a
street fight and arrested four Arab residents.
After the arrest, other residents started throwing rocks at the police forces. One policeman was hit in the head with a
rock and was injured. He was treated on the scene. The police fired two warning shots into the air and the crowd
dispersed.
In a separate incident also on September 26, a molotov cocktail was thrown at police and border patrol forces on patrol
in the Givati parking lot near the entrance to Silwan and the City of David. The molotov cocktail exploded but there were
no injuries.
A sweep of the area by border patrol found three other molotov cocktails and three suspects were arrested.

ZARDARI CALLS FOR FLOOD TAX
By Syed Irfan Raza
DAWN Thursday, 30 Sep, 2010
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari asked the government on Wednesday to levy a one-time flood tax on wealthy
people.
""A one-time flood tax will have to be imposed on the well-off and people of means to help shore up relief and
rehabilitation efforts,"" he said at a meeting of women ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of non-
governmental organisations.
""Unless we are prepared to share bread with our grief- and disaster-stricken brethren, we should not expect others to
help us.
""I have already advised the government to tap into indigenous resources wherever there is room,"" he said.

Subject: Dealing with Netanyahu
The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong
position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would
have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts.
In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a
marginal concern. And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in
the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking
(70 percent support the two-state solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear
that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud, who oppose
peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the
tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the government now, and is willing to
do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace. But as the elections grow
closer, more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government. They are
strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly
down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The longer he
waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next
elections.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775254 Date: 08/31/2015
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that he is
operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the belief that this
is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable price uses up a lot of
energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises doubts about his seriousness.
In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final concession, but only after wasting a lot of time,
making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners.
At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier""
(sucker) in front of his people to create a real problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the
cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he likes to
do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to broaden the
parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct negotiations provide the
opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of making a
deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further delegitimize its
standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal
with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling relations with the U.S.; and if he
doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance the future he is most concerned about - a
Hamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky (unusual for
him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent terror because they
believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will disappear and then he cannot
guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate his
seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he
cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And please forgive
me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working with him,
even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge him forward, not to
buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2.Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own purposes. The
Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security, from the vote at the
IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted Bibi's security requirements.
That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in terms of
what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about Abu Mazen's
politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a ""clarifying moment."" The world will of course blame Bibi. But you
should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated solution and a willingness to
engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The Israeli public and the American Jewish
Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and they should be allowed to draw their own
conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations and time is not on the side of any of them. They
will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as we keep the door open.

GUADALAJARA (AP) - Public safety officials in Mexico said gunmen ambushed a convoy of 20 police officers, killing nine
of them and leaving one missing. The officials in Jalisco state said ten officers who survived the attack fought an hours-
long battle with the unknown attackers, and several gunmen were wounded. The attackers, who were riding in about
ten sport utility vehicles, were armed with grenades and assault rifles. They fled into neighboring Michoacan state after
the attack. Michoacan is the home to a violent cartel known to launch fierce attacks on police convoys.

Subject: (Reuters) Vietnam to award Japan nuclear plants deal
TOKYO (Reuters) - Vietnam has decided to award Japan contracts to build two of four nuclear power plants it plans to
set up by the early 2020s, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung is expected to relay the Vietnamese leadership's decision on October 31 when he and Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kan meet for bilateral talks at a regional summit in Hanoi, Kyodo said. Earlier this month Japan said it
had agreed with Vietnam to cooperate on nuclear power plant technologies and materials. Japan, the world's third-
biggest nuclear power generator after the United States and France, is stepping up efforts to tap the nuclear power
development market overseas. In an effort to sell its atomic technologies abroad with the help of the government, a
joint venture of 13 Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was formed this
month.

HANOI (AP) - A Southeast Asian official said the leaders of Japan and China have held an informal meeting at
a regional summit amid a diplomatic row that has overshadowed the gathering. Surin Pitsuwan, secretary-
general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, confirmed that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan met Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of East Asian leaders in Hanoi,
Vietnam. There had been speculation they would not meet at all because of a dispute over a maritime territorial
dispute that plunged relations to a five-year low.

Dear Lanny,
I'm in Asia for the next ten days, so I'm copying George and asking him to read your email below and then contact you to discuss
your ideas. Thx for your concern, and thx also to George for following up w you. Hillary
souimate who, like me, agreed with every word of your speech.
""The Secretary did a SUPERP job and the audience responded with a
standing ovation. They loved her. I am grateful and relieved. We
many compliments.
Now I believe we can be helpful through the back door in breaking the stalemate.
We have an idea. Off the record - and you know I have never violated my word to you that only you know of my and efforts at
the time of the suspension of the settlements moratorium - we have an idea. But must remain back door and only becomes official
when principals propose and agree.
You said you could put me in touch with someone we both can trust to hear what we see as a way to break the stalemate.
I have two suggestions for us to talk to - old friends who know me and whom you trust:
I) Geo Mitchell - did you know Geo was my first ""boss"" in 1971 in a presidential campaign - Ed Muskies? (I was the ""national youth
coordinator"" when every ""youth"" I knew, including Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton, was for George McGovern)
2) Jim Steinberg - my buddy from my WH days.
Or whoever you suggest. We want to meet off-the-record, no one can know, to share this idea.
As to your speech - it must get wider circulation.
I am going to write about it in my Hill column next week (also appears on Huffington and Daily Caller). Can you have someone send
1 to me ASAP?)
My heart truly was tilled with gratitude and admiration for the courage you showed last night - courage because your words were
tough love equally for both sides.
Tough love for both sides.

Re: Kyrgyzstan crisis, report and recommendations
Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private
conversations with a range of leaders. He has sent me his confidential report. In light of
the crisis there—the pogroms that have created perhaps as many as 450,000 refugees,
according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27 constitutional referendum—he
explains. why and how this is an opportunity for joint U.S.-Russian action and other U.S.
initiatives. His policy recommendations follow his report.

From: Scott Horton
Date: June 17, 2010
Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan
I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the
members of the interim government, with special focus on foreign relations, security and
legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh,
I found that the interim government fully expected violence to break out there but did not
anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly acknowledged that the
government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was
extremely tenuous. They said they had severe ""loyalty"" problems with key figures in the
police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by ""loyalty,"" I was told that the
Bakiyev family had ""its people"" in key positions in the police and army and that they had
intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security
officers in the south. ""Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum,"" I was told.
Beknazarov told me he believed that, following the pattern of the last two revolutions,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative offices in the south,
following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke
with over the weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they
had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to instigate inter-ethnic violence.
Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful
investigation, but people I have spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders
directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of these individuals as
persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific
descriptions of events support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had
something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then Bakiyev adopted an extremely
cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the
referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an
iron-fisted central government through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics
used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevia and Radovan Karathle as
Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire
in programs like ""Operation Koltso."" If the government's charges bear out, serious
crimes were committed by the Bakiyev faction.
While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that
foreign intervention is no longer needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually
thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her government and its abilities.
Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily
count on the local police and military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in
turn suggests that the international community should give active consideration to both
the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.
2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on
being completely dysfunctional. It operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with
leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage appointments. Career civil service
personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days inside
the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly
observe primitive horse-trading, threats and counterthreats between key government
functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza Otunbayeva and a handful of figures
closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and. restraint. But Otunbayeva also
acknowledges that the limitations on her own authority and states that she ""has to put up
with it,"" at least for the moment. Three government members advised me during
meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running
for parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between
Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance, who could not refrain from criticizing one
another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the
glue that holds things together, commanding the respect of the other government
members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was almost universal—she appears
to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an
untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as
""president of the interim government"" presents some clear problems for her authority.
She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no democratic mandate. After the new
government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have democratic
legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be
eclipsed or at least made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government
recognize that she has essential skills that they do not—particularly her ability to
conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.
There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the
government. The next government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary
coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current seven factions will survive. Much
of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game of
parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty
and funds to use in the parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or
swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of parliamentary elections and the sense
that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and near
chaotic appearance of the current government.
3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government
put forward a proposed new constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a
referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift the country further in the
direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for
parliamentary minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president
Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the question of the constitution directly, pressing
them to retain a ""strong president"" system. They say this was coupled with not-very-
subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed,
with harmful consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about
holding the referendum as scheduled. The events in the south have resulted in the mass
displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population in the
south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their
current problems all come back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a
government with democratic legitimacy without a new constitution and new elections.
Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October
10). The crisis in the south presents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that
this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if indeed he did.
4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is
deeply fragmented on the question of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a
""pragmatic solution"" to the base issue under which it will be continued but placed on a
more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it
presents no friction for Kyrgyz-Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding
fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United States and Russia.
Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing
the base and seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the
clear impression that his attitudes were entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a
good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly that he could
accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats
to close the base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions
from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an
untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has somewhat
demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and
most senior member of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of
reason in the process. My impression based on discussions with numerous figures is that
Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government members are
agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and
that the base must rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more
under-the-table dealings with political figures.
5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in
mind when approaching the humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the
crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power. The interim government's
legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak
tools to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must
involve the creation of governments at the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh,
Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy. Delaying
this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This
highlights the need to conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible.
Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a ""Sophie's choice"" between the
United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely
participation). With President Medvedev's visit to the White House now on the horizon,
this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an international
humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that
could achieve U.S.-Russian co-sponsorship:
An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly
to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz agitators, including a number in uniform and operating
military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed groups are involved in
random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted
(rapes etc.) by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political
manipulation (including payment of money to drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at
fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek drug
baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also
suggests that criminal gangs involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for
engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an initiative of the deposed
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling
and criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate
and martial law rules including curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim
government. An imprimatur of support from the international community would help
establish the authority of the interim government in this process.
• Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to
leave the high risk zones, and access of humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for
humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to shelter them. The EU,
OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the
southern regions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable
distribution of humanitarian aid among those in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek
government may be particularly important in this process.
• Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support
special arrangements with broad international legitimacy and participation to enhance
peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I noted, even though
Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police
intervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her
confidential discussions Otunbayeva acknowledges the benefits in confidence building
that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international presence in the
region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for
designated sheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring
operations in tandem with local police and military, to build confidence in their protective
functions.
• Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be
undertaken into the events and their origin. The investigation should be under the aegis
of an international organization, such as the Security Council or OSCE and it should be
conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and
prosecutor. The investigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that
crimes against humanity were perpetrated, potentially including crimes of genocide. The
involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authority—policemen, military
figures, leaders of the civil administration—should be given special scrutiny in this
process. The person commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically
empowered to recommend criminal charges be brought against individuals identified in
his investigation—either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or before an
international body seized of proper jurisdiction.
Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as
many as 450,000 persons may have been displaced by the current violence. The
devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near total. There
will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and
healthcare. The international community under United States and Russian leadership
should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process, prioritizing its
assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.

• The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and
violence, the interim government may well conclude that the constitutional referendum
must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum, then extraordinary
measures should be taken.to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are
given an opportunity to vote—in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of
citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the democratic process that will be critical to the
resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize observers in
connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair
access to the ballot and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without
unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair and free manner across the
country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure
that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable
limitations in the process.

American Diplomacy Revealed -- as Good
By ROGER COH.E,N
NEW YORK-- Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiteakS dump of a 'quarter-million of their private or secret
cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write
clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-c.hatter about these admirable career diplomats whose
diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose byes have been upturned. Every
journalist knows that if their correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they
would lose most of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet,
particularly in the more conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable,

like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but
probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United
States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of
venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it
doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the ""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and
nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran
will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the
""shock"" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddati's
taste for voluptuous Slavic women and Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the
biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on embarrassment all these cables
are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to the
familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,""
""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,"" ""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have
become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled,
not least for this underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a
cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While we don't know nor might not ever know the real
June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was
systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad
'won big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was
evident to anyone in Tehran during_ the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The. .first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as
exercised a.s they are about Tehran in part because they know that any U.','_-;.-Iranian breakthrough
might make them more dispensable to the United States. Their vested interest in the prevailing
Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle East more than
overcoming the U.S.-Iranian Psychosis.
The second is that President .Barack Obarna's approach to Iran has been much more conventional
than his initial outreach suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very
quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with
""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,""
telling Europeans that ""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added
""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have been overcome; certainly this approach
guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
.Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an
interview with Time, he expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
""coming out with a. very interesting statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in
private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in Assange's words,
would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in
relation to Iran.""
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war
against Iran, an option he also favors. And. that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all
over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a
threat to democracy? He's a loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a
spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic
titillation but no gasp of discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their

may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu December 4 over the deadly fires raging in northern Israel, Israeli officials
said. The two leaders were not believed to have spoken since they last met in September when U.S.-backed peace talks
stalled in a spat over Jewish settlement construction. A statement from Netanyahu's office said Abbas ""expressed his

WikiLeaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how he
inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets <http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-28/wikileaks-
documents-chinas-google-hack-un-spying-more-secrets/> to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and
wicked—but their revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized
the press, you clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to
solve the most dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S.
policymakers and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical
information from foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of
pressure to apply on allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping
common action with cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not
by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777504 Date: 08/31/2015
hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve
crucial world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds
and lies. His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders
are really doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see
what was plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to
the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the
cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president
is a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—
No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need
for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.
Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

******************
The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.

Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

Subject: (CNN) Fayyad: Peace talks may need stronger U.S. mediation role
Washington (CNN) -- The United States may have to expand its role from Middle East peace talks facilitator to become a
broker on specific core issues, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said on December 12. Appearing on the ABC
program ""This Week,"" Fayyad indicated that progress toward a peace settlement could occur in the short-term despite
Israel's refusal to halt construction of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israel must
provide specifics about its position on core issues such as what a Palestinian state would entail, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees, Fayyad said, adding that the lack of a new settlement freeze erodes trust in the process.
Asked if the United States would need to offer so-called ""bridging"" proposals on specific issues to try to stimulate
negotiations, Fayyad said that ""may be necessary."" ""It may be unavoidable, actually, for the United States, acting as a
broker at some point, to come in with bridging proposals so we make this happen,"" he said. The interview, which
included Israeli opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, took place two days after U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton outlined a direction for the peace process after giving up on trying to persuade Israel to again freeze
settlement construction as a condition for the direct talks to resume.

Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and
Anthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their
family.
Secretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Passing of Richard Holbrooke
Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke
served the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and
high-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind --
a true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778383 Date: 08/31/2015
From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.
He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values
even under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,
helping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark
on the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,
people have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.
I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As
Secretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the
State Department and for the United States of America.
True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his
friends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to
everyone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.
Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-
children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and
colleagues.

Dear Huma and Jake:
If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me
personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible
evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up
after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way
Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an
appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.
Many thanks,
Suzanne

Remarks of the Spokesman of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan about the
Sudden Death of Holbrooke.
According to credible news agencies of the world, the American president's Special Envoy for
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, died in George Washington's University hospital
at the age of 69. He had been suffering from a heart's disease for the past days.
Appointed on 22nd January 2009, as special envoy for Afghanistan/ Pakistan, Holbrooke was
keeping an eye on the Afghan issue. Some times ago, he told reporters that he had been passing
through a difficult phase of his life, exerting crippling and sapping pressure on him.
He passed out in his exclusive office for Afghanistan and regional affairs on Friday last,
following his above-mentioned reveals and his life of toils and fatigues ended after admission
into a hospital where he breathed his last yesterday.
The American rulers have not made any remarks about the cause of his sudden death in view of
the sensitivity of the issue but rumors have it that this giant of the American politics and
diplomacy became ill with a heart disease when his previous fame and credibility came under
question after the unremitting failures of the mission of Afghanistan and his facing the difficult
task. The protracted Afghan war and the descending trajectory of the Americans' handling of the
warfare in the country had had a lethal dent on Holbrook's health as a high-ranking American
official. He was grappling with a constant psychological stress.
Emergence of this untoward phenomenon as an off-shoot of the Afghan issue is not now a strange
thing. The same was the case with the former Soviet Union as the crisis touched its climax.
Former Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Konstantin Cherninkove and Vladimir
Andropov had heart attacks in a short time distance before the coming to scene of Michael
Gorbachove. They relieved themselves of the hard task of the Afghan mission by retreating into
the lap of death.

The recent symptoms are indicating that an outbreak of the same epidemic diseases has
started in the political and military echelons of America.
A few months ago, an American four stars general„ general David Peteraeus, fainted
during a senate hearing when he faced tough questions as regards the issue of
Afghanistan. The end of Holbrooke, the fate of general Mc Crystal and the defense
Secretary Robert Gate's warning to step down show that the war of Afghanistan is heavily
weighing down on the psyche of the American military and political high-ups. Some of them
lighten their burden by simply going to the other world and others, while being still alive, choose
to avoid shouldering the mission.
The sudden death of a high-ranking American diplomat happens in a time that American
strategists under the chair of Obama have been reviewing the issue of Afghanistan for the past
few days. They will expectedly announce their decision soon.
We believe Holbrooke's timely death could have a didactic effect on the American strategists,
teaching them many things to learn. In view of the American entanglement in the aggravating
swamp of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls on the American powers-that-be
to abandon their dream of military domination and colonial sway in Afghanistan. Their
formulation of new military strategies will never change the imminent defeat into a victory in the
country. Still if they are bent on continuing with the status quo, they will face many unexpected
events and imbroglios. Their political and military circles will have to grapple with constant crisis
and untoward situations. Nothing more than that, they will achieve.

RAMALLAH (AP) - Palestinian negotiators are for the first time asking European countries to recognize a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even without a peace deal with Israel. The move is part of growing Palestinian
campaign to pursue statehood outside of peace talks with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
September. Palestinian officials say they asked the consuls general of France, Britain, Sweden and Denmark as well as
the European Union envoy to the peace process to recognize the 1967 borders between Israel and ""Palestine."" The EU
says it will recognize a Palestinian state ""when appropriate,"" but that negotiations are the only way to peace.

Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg
Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died,"" she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate ""in your face"" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a ""source,"" a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that
brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the INC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DOSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems
(MANPADS or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)
In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first step in this campaign was the April 30 bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.

The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Hezbollah. While the deaths of Sin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the TNC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These INC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of
April 25 from their own sources of information, the French General Directorate for External
Security (DOSE), and British external intelligence service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has
acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or
MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons
were originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to
meet secretly with these arms dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these
sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic in Southern Morocco, Algeria,
Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.

AQIM may also obtain SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan
rebellion's ruling Transitional National Council (INC) stated in confidence that they are
concerned that the death of al Qa-ida leader Osama Bin Laden will inspire al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, akihich were originally intended for
the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan.
These individuals fear that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the INC's
relationship with NATO and the United States, whose support is vital to them in their struggle
with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned that U.S. officials will
believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence
exercised by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of
April 25 from their own sources of information, the French General Directorate for External
Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has
acquired about 10 SAM 7- GrailiStreela man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members arid
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC Staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other

western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jai warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Beloasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of hie ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Zigiam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appearsthat whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Kelb knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tatham' from the government. El-Kelb also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters end is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel - Haltdh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NiC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obedoi, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with BeMO as
the ruler. El-Kalb pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hefter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Kelb gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jai will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj and his supporters In the opinion of
this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs

Hi Hillary, you are doing an amazing job as our Secretary of State and we are all immensely proud of you.
Really enjoyed your recent remarks regarding Afghanistan. Your words were spot on. Fyi, I will be in Kabul, Afghanistan
from 7 thru 14 April and am being hosted by Flamed Wardak, the son of the Afghanistan Secretary of Defense. Looking
forward to the visit.
There is some exciting personal news that I wanted to share with you. Although it has not yet been announced, I wanted
you to know that I recently interviewed with Cisco President ( John Chambers) and accepted a senior executive position
( effective 4 May ) to be the face and thought leader for Cisco in the field of ""Intelligent Urbanization"" with my focus
area being on Physical Safety and Security.
My wife (Faith) and I will live in Bangalore, India ( we are very excited ) and my area of responsibility will be the
emerging markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa . Since I will operate from India that particular country will be a major
focal point.
The use of the Network to improve the quality of life of Millions of people in areas such as Education, Health Care and
Security will be a major thrust of "" Intelligent Urbanization"". Faith and I are pumped up about our new overseas
adventure and the chance to work for a world class company and a superb business leader like John Chambers.
It is really a wonderful opportunity to positively impact many lives around the Globe.
Hope to perhaps call on you for a few minutes before I head over to India.
All the best and God Bless.
Sincerely, Dave

Our twittering guys confirmed that we don't tweet directly from HRC
The closest we come to that is to send out quotes from her official statements, e.g. using the format:

appears to be no first person Twittering in Secretary's Clinton's name.

Hi Cheryl,
I do not believe there is Twittering in the Secretary's name. The Twittering is from DipNote, the State Department's Blog
http ://twitte r.co mid ipnote
It will occasionally quote the Secretary but the Twittering should not be done in her name.

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.
There is a reference in Newsweek to her twittering and says: Hillary Clinton Style: Dry info and offers 4,788 followers
Can you advise who is twittering in her name and how we can address?
Thanks.

Dear Secretary Clinton:
As you know, last month eight rockets were fired into Kabul, two landing near the U.S.
Embassy.' Not long after, at least seven people were killed and 91 wounded, including children,
when a suicide bomber struck close to the Embassy. Following the second attack, a Taliban
spokesman declared that the target had been the U.S. Embassy itself.2 In response to these and
other incidents, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen conceded that the
situation in Afghanistan is ""serious and it is deteriorating.""3
In light of this increasingly violent and uncertain environment, effective security of the
U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the nearly one thousand U.S. diplomats, staff, and Afghan nationals
who work there4 is paramount. Security for the Embassy is provided under a Department of State
contract with ArmorGroup, North America (AGNA), which is now owned by
Wackenhut Services, Inc. (Wackenhut).5 Some 450 guards and their supervisors protect the
Embassy and are quartered at Camp Sullivan, a few miles from the Embassy.

The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) initiated an investigation after nearly
one-tenth of the U.S./ex-path guards individually contacted us to express concerns about and
provide evidence of a pattern of blatant, longstanding violations of the security contract, and of a
pervasive breakdown in the chain of command and guard force discipline and morale. This
environment has resulted in chronic turnover by U.S./ex-pat guards. According to the State
Department, ""nearly 90% of the incumbent US/Expats left within the first six months of contract
performance.""7 According to POGO sources, the U.S./ex-pat guard turnover may be as high as
100 percent annually. This untenable turnover prevents the guard force from developing team
cohesion, and requires constant training for new replacement recruits. The guards have come to
POGO because they say they believe strongly in the mission, but are concerned that many good
guards are quitting out of frustration or being fired for refusing to participate in the misconduct,
and that those responsible for the misconduct are not being held accountable.
After extensive interviews with eyewitnesses, and examination of documents,
photographs, videos, and emails, POGO believes that the management of the contract to protect
the U.S. Embassy Kabul is grossly deficient, posing a significant threat to the security of the
Embassy and its personnel—and thereby to the diplomatic mission in Afghanistan.
Ineffectual Oversight by the Department of State
Failed management of security contractors by the Department of State is not new, and
since the 2007 Iraqi Mansour Square massacre involving five Blackwater personnel, the State
Department has promised repeatedly to strengthen its oversight.8 Yet, as in Iraq, the Department
of State has utterly failed to properly manage another contractor, this time at the U.S. Embassy
Kabul, Afghanistan. State has repeatedly warned AGNA about its performance on this security
contract, but its threats have been empty. As a result, violations of the contract continue.
In June 2009, an investigation by the Senate Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight
revealed a pattern of ineffectual Department of State oversight of the AGNA contract.9 The
Senate found, for instance, that in July 2007, State issued a ""cure notice,"" a formal advisory that
AGNA's deficiencies were endangering the performance of the contract. In the cure notice, State
identified 14 performance deficiencies, including the failure of AGNA to provide an adequate
number of guards, relief personnel, and armored vehicles. The contracting official stated ""I
consider the contract deficiencies addressed below to endanger performance of the contract to
such a degree that the security of the US Embassy in Kabul is in jeopardy....

6 Ex-pat is short for expatriot, a blanket designation native-English-speaking guards use to describe themselves. The
term, as used by the guards, includes U.S. citizens as well as citizens from other English-speaking countries such as
Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.

In April 2008, the Department of State sent another cure notice notifying AGNA of
numerous other serious problems with its performance, including a lack of English proficiency in
a large portion of the guard force. State also cited AGNA for failing to correct many of the
deficiencies identified in the July 2007 cure notice, including those related to staffing and
training of the guard force. State further informed AGNA that, due to the contractor's continued
weaknesses and deficiencies, the Department was considering not extending the contract for
another year.11
In July 2008, despite AGNA's continuing problems, State decided to extend the contract
for an additional year, noting that based on satisfactory meetings with the incoming Wackenhut
managers, it was ""reasonable"" to expect that all performance problems would be corrected by
October of that year.I2 Just a month later, however, the Department of State reiterated to AGNA
that it questioned the contractor's ability to provide security for the U.S. Embassy in the hostile
environment of Afghanistan. Citing ongoing staffing concerns, State concluded that ""AGNA
needs to come quickly to terms with contract requirements especially in light of the current
incidents occurring in and around Kabul and the corresponding threat environment they pose.""13
By September 2008, AGNA's performance problems had grown so severe that
Department of State issued a ""Show Cause"" letterI4 and advised that it was considering
terminating the contract because the failure to provide an adequate number of guards ""has
negatively impacted the security posture of the Local Guard Program for the U.S. Mission to
Kabul....[T]he staffing situation has further deteriorated to a level that...gravely endangers
performance of guard services in a high-threat environment such as Afghanistan.""15
In March 2009, the Department of State again informed AGNA that it had ""grave
concerns"" relating to AGNA's continuing failure to provide sufficient numbers of guards. In
inspections of the guard force operations, the Department of State observed that 18 guards were
absent from their posts at the U.S. Embassy Kabul. In response, AGNA stated that the guards'
absences were due to ""supervisory personnel negligence.""I6
Despite these and other past problems, senior representatives from the State Department
and Wackenhut Services, Inc. offered sworn testimony at a June 2009 Senate hearing
that security at the Embassy is effective, and that previously identified problems had been fully

remedied.17 The State Department renewed the contract again through July 2010, with the option
to extend it until 2012.18 Yet the extensive evidence provided to POGO of continued security
problems at the U.S. Embassy Kabul counters those sworn statements; calls into question AGNA
and Wackenhut's ability to provide effective security of the Embassy; and makes a clear case
that the State Department has failed in its oversight of its security contractor.
Serious Security Vulnerabilities
Was Congress Misled?
Despite Wackenhut Vice President Sam Brinkley's sworn Senate testimony that ""...the
Kabul contract has been fully-staffed since January 2009..."" the truth is that chronic
understaffing of the guard force continues to be a major problem.19 And evidence suggests Mr.
Brinkley knew that. Around March, according to numerous participants, he was confronted by
some 50 guards at Camp Sullivan who complained to him directly about a severe, ongoing guard
shortage. Then, in an April 2009 memo to a State Department official, U.S. Embassy Kabul
guard force Commander Werner Ilic reported that guard shortages had caused chronic sleep
deprivation among his men. He described a situation in which guards habitually face 14-hour-
day work cycles extending for as many as eight weeks in a row, frequently alternating between
day and night shifts. He concluded that ""this ultimately diminishes the LGF's [Local Guard
Force's] ability to provide security."" (Attachment 1) The contract with the State Department
specifies that guards may not be on duty for longer than 12 consecutive hours.2° Interviewees and
documents reveal that short-staffing frequently results in the denial of contractually guaranteed
leave and vacation, and that those who do not comply are threatened with termination or actually
fired.
In further contradiction of Mr. Brinkley's assurances, the Knoxville News reported on
August 22 that Wackenhut has moved or is planning to deploy up to 18 guards from the nuclear
weapons facilities in Tennessee to cover guard shortages in Kabul, quoting a Wackenhut
spokesperson as confirming the use of the guards ""to deal with personnel shortages at the
embassy....""21

Communication Breakdown?
There is a significant problem with the guards' ability to communicate with each other:
most of the Gurkhas22—nearly two-thirds of the guard force—cannot adequately speak English.
Although most of the Gurkha guards are serious about their jobs and perform their duties in a
professional manner, the inability to speak English adequately has impaired the guard force's
ability to secure the Embassy. According to a Pentagon counter-terrorism expert, tactical
communications are critical to success in either preventing a gunfight or the successful execution
of one should it occur, and are part of the fabric of a good military or security unit. If different
languages are used, the fog of battle is significantly increased, small tactical formations do not
adjust as required, and close tactical formations are likely to fail in their mission. Further, any
soldier or security officer who does not know of changes in mission orders as the fight continues
is more likely to respond incorrectly, unnecessarily placing them in harm's way and increasing
the chances of unit fratricide. Poor tactical communications make mission failure highly
probable.
This is a real risk at U.S. Embassy Kabul. The language barrier between the non-English-
speakers and English-speakers has forced both sides to use pantomime in order to convey orders
or instructions and interpreters to convey facilitate radio communications. One guard described
the situation as so dire that if he were to say to many of the Gurkhas, ""There is a terrorist
standing behind you,"" those Gurkhas would answer ""Thank you sir, and good morning."" Clearly
this is an unacceptable situation, especially given that security emergencies require immediate
response.
The State Department has acknowledged the issue as a problem, but has not fixed it. In
June 2009, State officials briefed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight, admitting that ""inadequate English language
proficiency among the guard force"" remains a contract deficiency.23
Supervisors Engaging in Deviant Hazing and Humiliation
Guards have come to POGO with allegations and photographic evidence that some
supervisors and guards are engaging in near-weekly deviant hazing and humiliation of
subordinates. Witnesses report that the highest levels of AGNA management in Kabul are aware
of and have personally observed—or even engaged in—these activities, but have done nothing to
stop them. Indeed, management has condoned this misconduct, declining to take disciplinary
action against those responsible and allowing two of the worst offending supervisors to resign
and allegedly move on to work on other U.S. contracts. The lewd and deviant behavior of
approximately 30 supervisors and guards has resulted in complete distrust of leadership and a
breakdown of the chain of command, compromising security.
22 Gurkhas are people from Nepal and Northern India who are best known for their history of bravery and strength in
the Indian Army's Gurkha regiments and the British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas. The term ""Gurkha"" may also be
used generically to describe guards from the region who are employed by private security contractors. There is a
high degree of variability in the skills and training.

Numerous emails, photographs, and videos portray a Lord of the Flies environment. One
email from a current guard describes scenes in which guards and supervisors are ""peeing on
people, eating potato chips out of [buttock] cracks, vodka shots out of [buttock] cracks (there is
video of that one), broken doors after drnken [sic] brawls, threats and intimidation from those
leaders participating in this activity...."" (Attachment 2) Photograph after photograph shows
guards—including supervisors--at parties in various stages of nudity, sometimes fondling each
other. These parties take place just a few yards from the housing of other supervisors.
Multiple guards say this deviant hazing has created a climate of fear and coercion, with
those who declined to participate often ridiculed, humiliated, demoted, or even fired. The result
is an environment that is dangerous and volatile. Some guards have reported barricading
themselves in their rooms for fear that those carrying out the hazing will harm them physically.
Others have reported that AGNA management has begun to conduct a witch hunt to identify
employees who have provided information about this atmosphere to POGO.
Beyond basic decency standards, the situation at Camp Sullivan is clearly in violation of
AGNA's contract with the State Department, which specifies, ""Each contractor employee or
subcontractor employee is expected to adhere to standards of conduct that reflect credit on
themselves, their employer, and the United States Government.""24 More broadly, the behavior is
evidence of a complete breakdown of discipline and the chain of command among guards and
their leadership, itself a significant security issue.
In fact, an email from a current guard expressed concern about the impact of the
supervisors' behavior on the chain of command. ""I am convinced the greatest threat to the
security of the Embassy is the erosion of the guard forces trust in its leadership and ultimately
the [Department of State]. The failure of [the supervisors] to protect those they have been tasked
to lead is unacceptable, and if not held accountable will further compromise our mission. The
chain of command's failure to curtail [one supervisor's] deviant actions and to not hold him
accountable for countless infractions involving alcohol has made them ineffective. This has led
to threats and intimidation as the only means to accomplish the day to day operations here [at
Camp Sullivan] and at the Embassy. This is 'not' a onetime incident that went unnoticed by [his]
direct chain of command. These are events [that] took place over the past year and a half and
were ignored by the leadership at the cost of the well being of countless guard force members. If
these individuals are not held accountable for their actions it will only embolden those who
remain to make the same offenses against this guard force."" (Attachment 3)
Alleged Victimization of Afghan Nationals
An Afghan national employed as a food service worker at the guard corps' base at Camp
Sullivan submitted a signed statement dated August 16, 2009, attesting that a guard force
supervisor and four others entered a dining facility on August 1, 2009, wearing only short
underwear and brandishing bottles of alcohol. Upon leaving the facility, the guard force
supervisor allegedly grabbed the Afghan national by the face and began abusing him with foul
language, saying, ""You are very good for fXXXing."" The Afghan national reported that he ""was
too afraid of them I could not tell them any thing."" (Attachment 4)

There is also evidence that members of the guard force and their supervisors have drawn
Afghan nationals into behavior forbidden for Muslims. For example, photographs show guards
posing with Afghan nationals at the U.S. facility at Camp Sullivan as both the guards and
nationals consume alcoholic beverages in scenes that suggest drunkenness, and one photo shows
a near-naked U.S. guard who appears to have urinated on himself and splashed an Afghan
national. Afghanistan is a conservative Muslim country where alcohol consumption and public
nudity are considered offensive and, in some instances, prohibited by law.25
Supervisors Compromising Security?
Numerous guards raised concerns to POGO about a Spring 2009 extended
reconnaissance mission outside the Embassy perimeter for which guard force supervisors took
weapons, night vision goggles, and other equipment from Embassy stores. Photographs posted
on the internet show Embassy guards hiding in abandoned buildings in Kabul, armed, dressed as
Afghans (despite contractual requirements that they be in uniform when on duty), engaged in a
mission for which they had never trained. AGNA guards train for their mission of static security
of the Embassy, not for reconnaissance exercises away from the Embassy. This incident created
the danger that guards could have been drawn into a military incident with or taken hostage by
Taliban or Afghan locals, and created a vulnerability at the Embassy by removing military
equipment, leaving the Embassy largely night-blind. AGNA management awarded a
commendation to 18 participants trumpeting their ""Intrepidity"" in a document improperly
bearing the seal of the Department of State. (Attachment 5)
According to many guards, another situation in which Embassy security may have been
compromised is when, on at least one occasion, supervisors brought prostitutes in to Camp
Sullivan. This is a breach of security and discipline made worse because the prostitutes were
escorted to the facility by some guard force supervisors themselves. Some interviewees recalled
that two AGNA guard force supervisors made no secret that, to celebrate a birthday, they
. brought prostitutes into Camp Sullivan, which maintains a sign-in log. Women believed to be
prostitutes were observed attending the birthday party.
Is Protecting a U.S. Embassy in a Combat Zone an Inherently Governmental Function?
Because the diplomatic mission in Afghanistan is so critical, and because that mission is
in a combat zone, the need for effective Embassy security is particularly acute. Just this year at
the U.S. Naval Academy 2009 McCain Conference, there was a seminar on ""Ethics and Military
Contractors: Examining the Public-Private Partnership"" which looked at the question of whether
security in a combat zone is an inherently governmental function. According to the Executive
Summary of the conference, ""contractors should not be deployed as security guards, sentries, or
even prison guards within combat areas. [Armed Private Security Contractors] should be
restricted to appropriate support functions and those geographic areas where the rule of law
prevails. In irregular warfare...environments, where civilian cooperation is crucial, this

restriction is both ethically and strategically necessary.""26 Furthermore, Congress itself passed a
Sense of Congress that ""private security contractors are not authorized to perform inherently
governmental functions in an area of combat operations.""27 This language was watered down
from legislation that had passed the Senate actively prohibiting private security forces from
performing inherently governmental functions.28 In neither case, however, did the legislative
language recognize protecting a diplomatic mission in a combat zone as an inherently
governmental function. At the very least, this is a question that needs to be examined regarding
the protection of the U.S. Embassy Kabul and other embassies in combat zones.
The use of private contractors for security in a combat zone poses several dilemmas. One
is the inherent tension between the effective performance of a mission and the financial interests
of the contractor. Cutting costs is good for the bottom line, but can put security at risk. A legal
case against AGNA brought by two former U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force supervisors, James
Sauer and Peter Martino, illustrates this problem. According to the complaint, AGNA officials
""acknowledged that AGNA had underbid the contract in order to secure it,"" and told Sauer and
Martino ""to 'make do' and put a 'good face' on the situation to ensure that a profit would be
made on the contract and that shareholders would be satisfied....Defendants implemented plans
requiring more hours per individual and fewer shifts of staff in order to cut costs and maximize
Defendants' profit margin.""29 This is a clear example of the contractor endangering the U.S.
diplomatic mission in order to advance its bottom line.
Another dilemma is the threat of work-stoppages—which, according to witnesses, has
happened at least twice with the U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force. On two separate occasions,
the Gurkhas (who make up two-thirds of the guard force) threatened to walk off the job. In fact,
in one instance, buses had arrived in order to take the Gurkhas to the airport to return to Nepal.
According to POGO sources, the time it took to resolve just one of those incidents resulted in the
on-duty guard shift pulling an 18-hour day.
Yet another dilemma is that the laws in place do not adequately hold accountable
contractors who violate rules and endanger security in combat zones. Unlike the military, which
once had the responsibility of guarding embassies and which is bound by the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, private employers such as security firms cannot ensure a binding chain of
command that provides adequate discipline and professionalism in the guard force.

Contractor in Need of Oversight
POGO is concerned that the security of the U.S. Embassy Kabul is in the hands of a
contractor that has knowingly and repeatedly provided substandard equipment and services. For
example, to cut costs, AGNA ""downgrade[d] the quality of the vehicles to be purchased...."" 3°
AGNA sought to maximize its profit by sacrificing the quality of protective vehicles it bought to
secure the Embassy. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the State Department has repeatedly
chastised AGNA for the contractor's repeated failures to fulfill staffing, language, and other
contract provisions. AGNA has also failed to properly manage Camp Sullivan, as has been
detailed above.
The problems with AGNA's U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract do not appear to be
unique for this contractor. Recently, an ArmorGroup security guard in Baghdad's Green Zone
allegedly shot and killed two fellow guards and wounded at least one Iraqi. Extraordinarily, that
guard had a criminal record and was described by one security guard who worked with him as ""a
walking time-bomb,"" yet was hired by ArmorGroup anyway. I This particular incident raises
serious concerns about ArmorGroup's vetting process, and adds to the bigger picture of a
contractor in serious need of strict oversight.
Recommendations
1.After two years of failed attempts by the Department of State to upgrade the performance of
its private security contractors in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the Department should enter into an
arrangement with Defense Secretary Gates to provide immediate military supervision of the
private security force at the U.S. embassies in Kabul and Baghdad.
2. The State Department should promptly initiate a thorough and independent investigation of the
U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract in order to hold corporations as well as individuals
accountable for the above noted misconduct and contract violations. Simply removing a few
people from contract management at AGNA or Wackenhut, or creating a new corporate ethics
compliance officer, is not going to ensure serious accountability. Allowing those responsible to
quietly resign and seek work with other U.S. contractors, as guard force whistleblowers report is
happening now, will only perpetuate this problem.
3.State Department representatives either knew or should have known about this longstanding
and dangerous situation regarding U.S. Embassy Kabul security. The State Department's
repeated warnings to AGNA were of no consequence, and Department officials responsible for
oversight of this contract themselves should be held accountable.

4. Those whistleblowers who have come forward to disclose the mismanagement of this State
Department contract should be protected from retaliation for doing so.
5. The State Department should consider whether the security of an embassy in a combat zone is
an inherently governmental function, and therefore not subject to contracting out. The language
in the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act could be strengthened to prohibit the reliance on
private security contractors for inherently governmental functions, and to include protection of
the diplomatic mission in a combat zone as being inherently governmental. If embassy security
in combat zones is determined not to be an inherently governmental function, the State
Department should consider requiring military supervision of its private security contractors
guarding U.S. embassies in combat zones.
6. The State Department should consider initiating suspension and debarment proceedings
against the companies ArmorGroup North America, Inc. (AGNA) and Wackenhut Services, Inc.,
as well as against any individual employees of these companies who were responsible for
contract-related improprieties or abuses, to prevent these entities from entering into future
contracts with the federal government.

Dear Melanne:
Greetings from Bangladesh!!!
Bangladesh Foreign Minister Ms Dipu Moni will call on Secretary Clinton
on September 16 to discuss the details of the visit of Bangladesh Prime
Minister Ms ilas■na 'blazed to the USA during the UN General Assembly
meeting. Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a
friendly way.
I sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to brief her on our problems,
at the advice of the US ambassador in Dhaka. But it is now over six weeks,
her office never responded.
Almost every important person in Bangladesh congratulated me for receiving
the Presibential Meda; of Freedom. Prime Minister and her party said not
a word about it.
So you can see the depth of the problem.
I thought I should keep you briefed and let you figure out what to be done.

President Arias just called to ask about the Zelaya meeting. I gave him a readout and took him through the
statement, including word for word the part on elections.
Arias was very pleased. He even used the phrase ""beginning of the end of the de facto regime."" He liked our
idea of diplomatic outreach and I assured him that San Jose would be a top destination for us. He also
strongly endorsed our plan to go to Brussels, Madrid and the Vatican. He himself has spoken frequently with
the Spanish to get them to press for EU action similar to ours.
Finally, Arias was very pleased that Hugo plans to call in the candidates to get them to go to Micheletti and say
that an election outside the San Jose process is of dubious legitimacy.
I told Arias that the Secretary is very strong in her commitment to the San Jose process and Arias asked that I
give her his warm regards.

This tracks with all of the information that we have been picking up from the HOAF, Supreme Court and the Attorney
General's office. We've made clear in all of our conversations with regime contacts they would face ""grave
consequences"" if they violate the diplomatic sanctity of the Brazilian Embassy.
I hate to agree with the regime, but on this one they may be right. The calls from regime contacts appear synchronized
and are coming out of Managua, Guatemala, here in Tegucigalpa, as well as NYC. However, to be sure, we've made a
second round of calls. Both the Minister of Security and the Attorney General have again told us that the regime has
no/no intention of entering the Brazilian Embassy.

undermine Tony further. Powell (and Tony) appreciates Bill's willingness to write an op-ed, but understands
why it couldn't be published. Merkel remains the key. Having been for Tony, she is now neutral, but still

Asif Akhtar, Lahore: Urdu news channel anchors ... succeed in prompting Clinton to declare that far
from being dispatched, the money had only been set aside, and if the Pakistani people didn't want the
money they didn't have to take it. The open-ended question reduced a cackling room to pin-drop
silence, almost embarrassing the anchors for pursuing that line of questioning in the first place. It
seems none of the haughty anchors were ready to make the billion-dollar blunder by ticking off the
Secretary of State and losing all that aid money.
Clinton handled most of the questions and concerns with a calm and a poise people would have
never expected from her predecessor Condaleeza Rice, who would have been more comfortable
carrying out the offensive without the charm.
Given the circumstances, this attempt by a US official at bridging the gap between Pakistani
opinions and US policy is commendable.
Maryam, Lahore: We need to use our heads rather than our emotions all the time. its time to reflect
where we went wrong as a nation too.'

them around her little finger. Mrs. Clinton on the other hand carried herself like a true diplomat and a

Why the Greg Craig debacle matters
By: Elizabeth Drew
November 19, 2009 11:58 AM EST
President Barack Obama is returning from his trek to Asia Thursday to a capital that is a
considerably more dangerous place for him than when he departed.
While he was abroad, there was a palpable sense at home of something gone wrong. A
critical mass of influential people who once held big hopes for his presidency began to
wonder whether they had misjudged the man. Most significant, these doubters now find
themselves with a new reluctance to defend Obama at a phase of his presidency when he
needs defenders more urgently than ever.
This is the price Obama has paid with his complicity and most likely his active
participation, in the shabbiest episode of his presidency: The firing by leaks of White
House counsel Gregory Craig, a well-respected Washington veteran and influential early
supporter of Obama.
The people who are most aghast by the handling of the Craig departure can't be
dismissed by the White House as Republican partisans, or still-embittered Hillary Clinton
supporters. They are not naïve activists who don't understand that the exercise of power
can be a rough business and that trade-offs and personal disappointments are inevitable.
Instead, they are people, either in politics or close observers, who once held an
unromantically high opinion of Obama. They were important to his rise, and are likely
more important to the success or failure of his presidency than Obama or his distressingly
insular and small-minded West Wing team appreciate.
The Craig embarrassment gives these people a new reason — not the first or only reason
— to conclude that he wasn't the person of integrity and even classiness they had thought,
and, more fundamentally, that his ability to move people and actually lead a fractured and
troubled country (the reason many preferred him over Hillary Clinton) is not what had been
promised in the campaign.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
This may seem like a lot to hang on a Washington personnel move. After all, intramural
back-stabbing or making people fall guys when things go wrong (think Bill Clinton's
Defense Secretary Les Aspin after the disaster in Somalia) are not new to
Washingtonians.
But Craig's ouster did not occur in a vacuum. It served as a focal point to concerns that
have been building for months that Obama wasn't pressing for all that might be possible
within the existing political constraints (all that one could ask of a president); that his
presidential voice hadn't fulfilled the hopes raised by his campaign voice (which had also
taken him a while to find); that he hadn't created a movement, as he had raised
expectations that he would; that would be there to back him up and help him fulfill his
promises.
That is why it is worth pondering how the Craig story, unfolded in detail — its
consequences likely will echo far longer than anything Obama said or did in Asia.
Briefly, here's what happened, some of it told for the first time: Craig, who had known the
Clintons since they were all at Yale Law School together, had served as a senior adviser
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but in 1998 gave up that job to help defend Bill
Clinton against impeachment. Yet in 2008, he supported Obama for the nomination — not
so much a turning against Hillary Clinton as being impressed early, as were some other
prominent Washingtonians, by the then-state senator but would-be U.S. Senate candidate
at a fundraiser held by Vernon Jordan, seeing Obama as the first potentially inspiring
Democratic figure since Robert Kennedy. In the course of the campaign, Craig wrote a
highly publicized memo questioning some of Hillary Clinton's claims of foreign policy
experience, such as coming under enemy fire in Tuzla, Bosnia. During the campaign,
Craig coached Obama for the debates (playing McCain), and praised him highly. Craig's
imprimatur helped the neophyte Obama in certain influential circles.
He hoped to get a high foreign policy position in an Obama administration, but when
Clinton was named secretary of state, this of course became untenable. The Clintons are
an unforgiving lot. So, Obama and Craig agreed that Craig would take the job of White
House counsel for a year, and then they'd discuss what he'd do next. Thus, Craig was
handed a very tricky portfolio.
During the transition, about mid-December, Craig presented to a group of the president's
newly named national security advisers meeting in Washington — including Clinton,
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, national security adviser General James Jones, and
others — three proposed executive orders: One ordered the shutting down of Guantanamo
in a year. (The others banned torture and closed down the C.I.A.'s ""black sites""; and
addressed future detainee policy.) The one-year target for closing Guantanamo resulted
from consultations with human rights and detainee rights groups, who argued that
Guantanamo could be shut down in three months, and with Pentagon officials, who had
no united position but argued that it would take from a year to 18 months.
At the meeting, only the newly named Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano,
beamed in from Arizona, questioned whether a year was realistic. When Gates, as he
later confirmed publicly, said that though it was an ""ambitious"" deadline, he supported it
because setting it was the only way to get things, especially the bureaucracy, moving
toward that end, and that it could be extended if it couldn't be met, that was it.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
Obama's new national security team signed off on the executive order to close
Guantanamo in a year. This was passed along to the president as well as his top aides;
Craig was never in a meeting with the political side of the White House on the
Guantanamo matter — and the president-elect and then president raised no objection
before, when, or after he signed off on it.
Unsurprisingly, the deadline became hard to meet, for various legal and political reasons -
including the congressional outburst of NIMBYISM (similar to its earlier outbursts on Dubai
Ports and even Terri Schiavo — short-term, irrational, and politically motivated fits that
erupt from the Congress from time to time). If Craig failed to foresee this (as some later
charged), he had a lot of company.
The closing of Guantanamo is undoubtedly far further along than it would have been
without the executive order. But along the way, Craig fell out of favor with the president's
political aides and, apparently, the president himself. Whether he was simply being made
the fall guy, or the tight circle of Chicagoans in the White House didn't care for this
outsider, or he committed some unknown errors, suddenly, in August, leaks began to
surface that his job was in danger. Non-denial denials were issued from the White House.
The leaks became a pattern, a systematic, anonymous, tipping off of reporters that Craig
would soon be gone.
Craig was accused, anonymously of course, of a welter of charges: of being ""too close to
the human rights groups"" (if so, what was wrong with that?), of not playing well with
others, of being a bad manager, of being fixated on Guantanamo to the detriment of other
issues. In the summer, Obama offered Craig another job, which Craig declined, and the
two agreed that they would discuss the matter further later in the year. But the leaks
continued, and Craig decided that his situation was untenable, and he had to leave.
To make sure he did, he was leaked his way out, up to the day before he planned to
resign. What caused so many Obama supporters' stomachs to turn was that Obama could
have stopped the leaking at any time; he or White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
could have arranged a dignified departure. (They're within their rights to get rid of
someone if they're dissatisfied, for good reasons or not — but a preferred route would be to
call that person in and ask what day would suit him or her to resign, and then just let that
person do it. This happens a lot in administrations; even if people don't believe the
resignation was voluntary, there's a soupcon of dignity left to that person.) Even some
Hillary Clinton supporters, who still hold no brief for Craig, think he was treated shabbily.
And this opinion is not confined to ""political junkies."" Thomas Wilner, a distinguished
Washington attorney who challenged Bush administration detainee policies, particularly on
Guantanamo, and had worked with Craig on these issues, told me, ""There's a lot of
concern among a lot of lawyers in this town, especially those who were supporting
Obama, that somebody this bright, this respected, this good, and with this integrity, was
treated in such a way.""
Yes, we knew, or should have, during the campaign that the supposed idealist Obama
had a bit of the Chicago cut-throat in him, but there was little sign that he could be as
brutal and heedless of loyalty as he was in the Craig affair. An unexpected climate of fear
emanates from the Obama White House.
The incident underscored worries that several had held about the Obama White House for
some time: that it was too tightly controlled and narrowly focused by the Chicago crowd;

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
that it seemed from the outset to need an older, wiser head, someone with a bit more
detachment.
The current crowd displays a certain impulsiveness and vindictiveness that do it no good -
as in the silly war-let on Fox News that it is now trying to back out of. Even if Craig was
making a hash of his job — and there's no independent evidence of this — it just wasn't
smart to treat someone widely held in such high respect in this manner; once again, the
impulsiveness backfired.
The replacing of Craig with Washington attorney Robert Bauer, Obama's own attorney for
years as well as counsel for the Democratic National Committee and the Obama
campaign, further narrowed the White House circle just when it needed broadening,
lowered the stature of the office, and choosing the president's personal attorney for a
position that calls for dispassionate judgment is hazardous. (Does anyone remember
Alberto Gonzalez?)
The Obama's themselves hang tight with a small Chicago crowd. Yes, he talks to others,
and yes, a president's time is very limited, but the Obama's themselves seem as closed-
off and unto themselves as does his inner White House circle. (Is this a coincidence?
What is all this wariness about?) When the Obama's go to someone's house for dinner,
almost invariably it's to that of Valerie Jarrett, the old friend from Chicago who serves as a
counselor and whom they see all day. Old Chicago friends fly in for weekends frequently.
Old friends, who had helped launch him, helped them personally, have been left behind.
At the same time as the Craig imbroglio happened, many people who had defended
Obama against charges that he wasn't what he'd been cracked up to be were now
becoming concerned themselves: though it was a relief to have a president who thought
through crucial decisions about sending the country's young to war, it was taking him
awfully long to make up his mind about what to do about Afghanistan and Pakistan, and
the decision-making was bafflingly leak-ridden (was this a deliberate airing of ideas or a
loss of control over the process?); that the health care debate had in fact careened out of
his control and it seemed less and less likely that, having used up almost a year of his
presidency on it (his ""deadlines"" had become irrelevant, and so, in a way, had he), he
would end up with a bill, if at all, that did enough net good.
Certain things are not his fault: the unprecedented truculence of the Republican Party,
scared silly by right-wing ranters on cable television; the unholy economic and foreign-
policy mess that he inherited; the fact that he never had, as so many liberal commentators
asserted, the 60 (or 58 or 59) Senate votes that would enable him to get what he wanted
from the Congress. It's not his fault that unemployment rates remain stubbornly high
following a traumatic recession.
And it's always risky to project the long-term from the moment. Perhaps this will prove to
have been a passing moment. Perhaps Obama will still salvage a health care bill that is a
real step forward (though there will be a humongous fight over its definition); maybe he'll
come up with a smart strategy — or the best of bad options — on Afghanistan and Pakistan;
it's not impossible that he'll add real progress on climate change and regulatory reform to
his list of achievements, and that he'll start to get the deficit under control.
Maybe there'll be enough examples of grace that will make people forget this period of
pettiness. He's been lucky before; maybe he'll get lucky again. Meanwhile, serious people
who had a lot of hope about him and who defended him are more worried than ever, and

I also alerted Michael to the fact that Asha's brother was seriously wounded in the bombing. I have asked that they get
a full name as soon as possible and to see what we can do through the TFG, the UN and AMISOM to have him flown to
Nairobi. Michael said that he and the embassy have already arranged for a private hospital in to treat the seriously

Finally, Michael has spoken to Sheik Sharrif extended our condolences and encouraged his resolve. I will be speaking to

FYI. Kamala
North's leaders clash on devolution
The North's leaders Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness clashed in public today as the split at the heart of
the power-sharing government deepened.
The clash came as Taoiseach Brian Cowen lead a team of Government ministers in a session of cross-Border
talks with members of the Northern Ireland administration.
As the pair appeared before the cameras at a press conference their private disagreement over the devolution of
policing and justice powers to the Stormont Assembly deepened when Mr McGuinness accused his counterpart
of raising roadblocks to a deal.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766177 Date: 08/31/2015
As the men stood side-by-side in front of the media, a visibly angry Mr Robinson effectively reprimanded his
opposite number accusing him of bringing private details into the public domain.
The temperature rose as Mr McGuinness continually shook his head in disagreement as Mr Robinson spoke.
The Sinn Fein deputy leader hit out at Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) calls for a scrapping of the Parades
Commission, which rules on Orange Order parades, and said it could not be a pre-condition to a deal on the
transfer of policing and justice powers.
Mr McGuinness: ""I move forward against the backdrop of the agreements that I made with Peter Robinson 13
months ago where we agreed an over-30 step approach to the transfer of powers on policing and justice.
""I have to say at no stage in that process was the issue of issues being used as pre-conditions for the transfer of
power for policing and justice mentioned.""
In a reference to a DUP letter to the Prime Minister demanding 'confidence building' measures for unionists
before a deal, Mr McGuinness added: ""At no stage were people contemplating sending, on solo runs, letters to
Prime Ministers which effectively I had not seen, was not made aware of and was completely surprised by.""
Mr Robinson hit back by claiming republicans had already backed reform of parades, but had now opted to
delay the measures as a tactic.
The First Minister, who glanced at his adviser and became visibly angry as Mr McGuinness spoke, added: ""I
regret the tone of the latter remarks.
""I don't think that it is helpful for us to be going into the finer details of these matters, but nobody is in any
doubt that the issue of parades was moving forward and was held back.""
The exchanges were seen as a public demonstration of the two leaders' long-running private dispute.
Mr McGuinness is already on record as having said that he has not been able to build an adequate relationship
with Mr Robinson, despite having enjoyed a good working relationship with his predecessor as DUP leader, Ian
Paisley.
The North-South Ministerial Council, first formed under the Belfast Agreement of 1998 is marking its tenth
anniversary, but proceedings today were overshadowed by fears for the future of the Stormont Assembly.
Today's meeting in Limavady, Co Deny, brought together ministers from North and South, who announced
progress on a series of cross-Border projects.

Subject: (Reuters) China says Britain sowing discord in climate politics
BEIJING - China condemned claims ascribed to Britain's climate change minister that it had ""hijacked"" negotiations in
Copenhagen, saying on Tuesday the accusations were an attempt to sow discord among poor countries.
The sharp words from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu were the latest baring of diplomatic bad blood
after the talks in Copenhagen ended on Saturday with a broad, non-binding accord that fell short of hopes for a robust
global agreement on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Jiang was responding to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper that said the Environment Minister Ed Miliband had
accused China, Sudan, Bolivia and other left-wing Latin American nations of ""hijacking"" efforts to reach deeper
agreement on how to fight global warming.
In a separate commentary for the paper, Miliband said China vetoed a widely supported proposal at the Copenhagen
talks to aim to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
""We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked,"" he also wrote, but without singling out
China or any other country as a ""hijacker.""
Chinese spokeswoman Jiang did not chide Miliband by name, but Beijing's ire was clear.
""The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme,"" she said in a statement issued by the
official Xinhua news agency.
""Their objective is to shirk responsibilities that should be assumed towards developing countries, and to provoke discord
among developing countries. This scheme will come to nothing.""
The flap is unlikely to seriously disrupt negotiations seeking to turn the Copenhagen accord into a legally binding treaty.
But the sour exchange has underscored the distrust between China and rich countries that could frustrate efforts to
agree on that treaty by late 2010.
""Everyone is raising the banner of protecting the planet, but in reality they are protecting their own interests,"" Wang Vi,
a climate change policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters.
""The compromises (in Copenhagen) were very, very limited.""
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities and its biggest developing economy.
Other governments have pressed it to do more to reduce its growing emissions and to submit its emissions goals to
international checks as part of any new climate pact.
But China and other big developing countries have accused the rich economies of failing to offer big enough cuts to their
emissions, and of not offering enough money and technological help to poor countries to cope with climate change.
Chinese experts have also said the goal of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 is empty
rhetoric without those commitments from rich nations.
""Currently, the most difficult issue to resolve is the scale and structure of each country's emissions reductions,"" said Li
Zhiqing, an environmental policy professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, writing in the city's Wenhui Daily
newspaper.
""Clearly, there will be no breakthrough on this in the near term and we can only maintain the status quo,"" wrote Li.

Hi Huma — could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the
letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the
GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it
is still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which
challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the
Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final
conclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.
Embassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.
Sincerely,

McHale sees positive side of Islam in Bangladesh

M. Serajul Islam
MS. Judith A McHale, US Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs, who was recently in Dhaka, is the senior most
ranking US Government official to visit Bangladesh since President Obama took office in USA and Sheikh Hasina in
Bangladesh. During her public engagements, she made some remarks that are very encouraging for Bangladesh. In
Dhaka University she said that US would take 20,000 students every year from Bangladesh where at the moment, the
intake is far fewer.
The Under Secretary made more encouraging remarks when she addressed Madrassah students of Uttar Badda Islamia
Kamil Madrassah. When a student informed her that Madrassah educated students are seldom given US visa for
education, she said categorically that US doors are open to Madrassah educated students of Banagladesh. She also said
that the US Embassy is providing teachers for teaching English in Madrassahs and her Government ""is proud to be
working with the Madrassah."" She also said that religious leadership is a key to the success of socio-economic
development efforts. Her most positive remark was her belief that Bangladesh could assist the US to bridge its gap with
the Muslim world.
The Under Secretary however did not say how many Madrassah students who would be given visa annually as she did
for the general students.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767282 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767282 Date: 08/31/2015
This notwithstanding, the fact that a senior Obama administration official has publicly made positive remarks for the
Madrassah educated students and role of Islam in society is very significant. Her statement came on the back of a
number of other initiatives that the US Government has taken in Bangladesh to work with the Madrasahs. The US
Government is working with a number of NGOs to sensitize Madrassah students on democracy, information and
communication technology, etc.
This is a significant change in US stance on Bangladesh. Not very long ago, the US Ambassador to Bangladesh Harry
Thomas was crying hoarse about religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh; that was dismissed by the BNP Government.
The Awami League went overboard to spread the news that Bangladesh was seething with religious fundamentalism,
even labeling the BNP Government as ""Taliban"". Early in 2006, the US Assistant Secretary for South Asia, Ms. Christina
Rocco, on an official visit to Bangladesh, strongly advised the Government that it had no choice but to rein in the
religious fundamentalists, that later led to the arrests of Bangla Bhai and the JMB terrorists. The BNP Government
arrested religious terrorists in a make believe manner that was a far cry from the dangerous portrayal about them in the
media and by the opposition, when they were at the height of their criminal activities.
The meekness of their surrender and their execution under the Caretaker Government without any repercussion from
their cadres who were supposed to on the verge of capturing power by force left no doubt that the case of religious
extremists in Bangladesh was over politicised and overstated. They raised their ugly face in no uncertain terms because
the BNP Government indulged and encouraged them. The national elections in December 2008, in which over 20 million
first time voters entered the election process further sealed the nation's contempt for political parties in Bangladesh
that use religion for achieving their ends. In fact, even the BNP found the religion based parties a political liability in the
last elections when the biggest of the religion based parties in Bangladesh, the Jamat-e-Islami could manage just 2 seats.
Although the parties that have used religion for politics have been historically rejected by voters in Bangladesh,
interestingly Islam as a religion has made significant inroads into the lives of the overwhelming majority of its people
since independence. There are many reasons for this that is outside the scope of this writing. This spread of Islam, unlike
in many other countries, is still tampered by liberal traditions embedded in the history of the religion in this part of the
world where Sufism has played a major role. Nevertheless, the resurgence of Islam in Bangladesh also faces the dangers
of evolving in the opposition direction. It is an issue that must be dealt with the utmost caution to deter Bangladesh
from following Algeria or Afghanistan.
Soon after the Awami League came to power early last year, a vested group was busy spreading distorted information to
create public opinion against the Qoami Madrasahs (QM) and calling for restoration of secularism by removing Islam
from public life. A World Bank Report later trashed the propaganda against QM, one that suggested that under BNP
Government 35% soldiers recruited were from QM. There was a period of lull in the campaign of this group against Islam
based political parties and the Madrasahs after the WB report, although the report may not have been alone responsible
for the lull.. The annulment of the fifth amendment of the constitution, the war trial criminals that would involve mostly
the Jamat; and the recent activities of Jamat's student cadre in the universities have re-activated the move. A section is
claiming the restoration of the 1972 constitution to ban the Jamat.
Ms Judith McHale's visit is very significant in the present context of Bangladesh's politics. Unlike Ms Christina Rocco's
visit in early 2006, she did not sound any alarm bells for Bangladesh on the issue of religious fundamentalism. To the
contrary, her visit to the Madrassah, together with the initiatives of her Government to work with the Madrasahs of
Bangladesh by providing them with modern educational tools are positive signs that US is not worried about 'religious
fundamentalism' in Bangladesh and that it even visualises a role for Bangladesh to help it reach out more towards the
Muslim world. Some months ago, the US Government dropped the name of Bangladesh from the watch list of countries
where religious freedom is at stake. This is another indication that religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh is on the
decline in US perception

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord: Both delegations reached agreement this morning on the text of the preamble to the
""Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord."" They also reached agreement on Article 8 (Final Dispositions), the calendar of
implementation of the Accord (Article 9), as well a final declaration (Article 10). Both delegations also prepared a new
Article (11) giving thanks and special mention for their support to the U.S. (President Obama and Secretary Clinton), the
OAS and President Arias. Both delegations signed the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord about mid-day today. As per its
terms, the Accord is effective the moment it is signed. Both delegations also submitted a copy of the Accord to the
National Congress about 2 PM this afternoon. The two sides plan to continue working this weekend with support from
OAS staff re selecting the four member (2 Honduran and 2 international) Verification Commission. Both delegations
expressed a strong preference for nominating Colin Powell (improbable due to his heavy travel schedule). Other names
being considered include President Lagos of Chile, Sanguinetti of Uruguay, Governor Bill Richardson and Senator Mel
Martinez. The Accord calls for the Verification Commission to be created by November 2. We understand that OAS
Secretary General Insulza plans to arrive in Tegucigalpa on Sunday, November 1. The OAS is helping to organize a public
ceremony commemorating the Accord on the morning of November 2. Both sides and the OAS plan to invite regional
heads of state and foreign ministers. We expect President Arias and other Central American heads of state to attend the
ceremony. We've heard that Z and M are already in contact, through intermediaries, with the objective of creating a
government of national unity. Under the terms of the Accord, the new government must be formed between the
signing of the Accord (today) and NLT November 5.
While the current calendar of implementation appears to be going well, we expect Congressional approval of Article 6 to
be complicated. While the presidential candidates support the Accord, there is concern within the parties about the
timing of its implementation, particularly on the eve of the election. We will continue to reach out to political leaders
and all sides and encourage them to support the expeditious implementation of the Accord.

Diplomatic Front: We've heard that the regime Foreign Ministry is inviting Ambassadors back into the country. The
Swedish Ambassador, who is resident in Guatemala, is here on a visit and plans to attend the Accord ceremony on
November 2. We are also expecting the Spanish Ambassador, Ignacio Ruperez, to arrive this weekend. OAS PODIR
Victor Rico told us that he plans to return to DC tomorrow, but will come back later next week.
Elections: The Swedish Ambassador told me she will be meeting with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and discuss the
renewed Swedish elections assistance. We also understand that the Japanese are planning to move forward with
support for the elections process. Finally, the UN pulled back plans to withdraw its elections technical assistance
team. Most eyes, however, are on the OAS and specifically what the Permanent Council will do about sending an
elections observer mission.

Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

We are safe but Port-au-Prince is destroyed. My appartment is gone.
FOKAL is safe fortunately but a few employees had their homes destroyed, like mine. The phones don't work so it is
easier to stay in touch by internet.
The situation is dramatic. the governement is powerless. The Palace, the Parliament, the Ministries, the Minustah are
non operational. We cannot count the dead. is dead and Minustah's headquarters collapsed. We ran out of
medical supplies, water, food for the first reliefs, and then we have to think about reconstruction.
As soon as we can talk I'll call you to talk about specifics.
The hard part is that there have been over 40 repeats after the first tough seism and we don't know if it is over yet.
We keep in touch.

Huma, I wanted to relay to you the sincere sentiments of appreciation expressed by the PM's Office and the MFA for the
very personal touch by the Secretary notifying the PM about postponement of the trip. Not lost on the GPNG is the fact
that the entire trip was postponed, not the PNG portion. As you can imagine that is politically very significant.
Naturally, we stand ready to reconstitute the program or enhance it should the trip move forward at a later date. We
got luck today w/the weather—not a rain cloud in sight.
Safe travels, and hopefully we will work together at a later date. Best of luck with the Haiti recovery effort!

LONDON (AP) - President Barack Obama's planned nuclear summit in Washington next week will go on without Britain's
leader. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told Obama he'll be staying in London to concentrate on a hotly
contested May election. Brown told Obama in a phone call that he will send Foreign Secretary David Miliband to
represent Britain at the April 12-13 meeting. Obama is hosting dozens of world leaders to discuss the spread of atomic
weapons and the threat of nuclear terrorism. Brown's Labour Party is seeking a fourth term in office but the opposition
Conservatives are ahead in the polls and favored to take power for the first time since 1997.

Subject: HRC meeting with the IMF?
Cheryl, Jake,
I received a call from Masood Ahmed, Director of the Middle East Department at the IMF. Apparently at the Haiti
meeting in NYC, the Secretary had a conversation with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in which she
expressed an interest in meeting with him to discuss the IMF's work in Haiti and other places.
A few weeks earlier, apparently she talked briefly with Mr. Ahmed at a meeting about Pakistan, and also expressed an
interest in meeting with the IMF to discuss their work.
The Managing Director would be very happy to meet with her. But I think they wanted to know whether she was really
interested in meeting, or whether she was being diplomatic and polite. For what it's worth, I think a meeting could be
very useful. Someone from Treasury would want to sit in.
How should I respond to them?
Thanks.

ENGEL OFFERS STRONG SUPPORT FOR
ENERGY AND CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP OF THE AMERICAS
Washington, DC--Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the
Western Hemisphere, issued the following statement today to recognize the Energy and Climate Ministerial of
the Americas, held on April 15-16 in Washington DC.
""I would like to offer my strong support for the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the Americas being held
today at the Inter-American Development Bank and at the Organization for American States on April 16. I
attended the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2009 when President Obama announced
the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) to address the energy and climate change
challenges facing the region. The challenges are many as seen in frequent blackouts in major cities in the
region and the lack of access to electricity in the rural countryside. Energy poverty, energy inefficiency and
poor infrastructure have a direct impact on economic growth and development in many countries.
""The Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas is an effort to address these issues head on. But it's not
an initiative that places the United States in a role in which it provides all the assistance or direction. It's
innovative since it sets up a voluntary and flexible framework that is open to governments, private industry, and
civil society to lead or participate in initiatives that reflect their priorities. Many countries in the Western
Hemisphere such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Canada plan on leading initiatives under ECPA. El
Salvador, Chile, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago will set up Clean Energy Technology Centers to serve as
sources of expertise on renewable energy technologies.
""I applaud the efforts of the representatives of the 32 countries and over 200 businesses and civil society
organizations attending the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the Americas. Many initiatives will be
announced during the Ministerial. It's impressive to see the fast progress on ECPA since President Obama
announced it last year. This is clearly a sign of the new relationship that the Obama Administration would like
with the countries of the Western Hemisphere - an inclusive one based on partnership and focused on pragmatic
problem solving and not political posturing. I plan on working with President Obama, Secretary of State
Clinton, and Energy Secretary Steven Chu to make sure the goals and priorities of the Energy and Climate
Partnership of the Americas are met.""

Day of the dead
More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with
government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.
By Max Blumenthal
Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad
Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated
tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence
suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been dead
for seven months.
However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar
circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot
not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no
reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the
deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.
Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the
poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as
maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like
them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.
Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows
who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced
allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers
must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are
the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the
highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are
only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.
One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.
Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population
in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of
people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law
enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and
they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old
West, but with a grim 21st century edge.
Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have
yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is
hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy
towards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in
Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.
But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family
members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out
even if it means threats and other reprisals.
Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities
have done little to investigate. ""Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,"" the
mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. ""They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week
later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got
witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.""
Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and
murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of
its efforts at economic expansion.
To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10
people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference
and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal
government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County
were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number
of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.
That's Juarez today.
The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern
shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national
average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or
so maquiladoras for their livelihoods.
To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a
luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,
many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes
can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the
maquiladoras' featureless walls.
Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent
colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,
electricity or paved roads.
Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio
Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a
vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back
and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,
however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where
many of the slain and missing women were last seen.
In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside
the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.
""A lot of girls were picked up here,"" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. ""But really, it's the girls' fault. It's because
even though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to get
into those cars if they didn't want to.""
Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered
by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.
""Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends
violently,"" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. ""It's difficult to
know.""
A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large
majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.
Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and
with little means of contacting their families back home.
The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.
An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much
as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are
caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so
high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little
pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.
Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own
maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment
subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor
manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant
down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their
peak in October 2000.
Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health
system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their
company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-
women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July
alone.
The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually
invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain
women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.
Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed
upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,
the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of
drinking.
Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The
effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have
posted banners on their factories reading: ""STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite."" But most foreign
companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have
maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.
Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven
others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the
street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a
Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.
Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --
recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darkness
of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late
after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their
shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her
worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.
Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public
statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another
wave of violence. ""Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,"" she said. ""[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen
on Lear property.""
When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her
with responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious
situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home
from Lear's plant on her last day.
""We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,"" Puchalsky said. ""When she had arrived late to work her
shift, she was not there in time to work her shift.""
When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their
shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear's
operations. ""There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,"" she said. ""Typically what we do
is if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrive
late, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.""
The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,
and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad
Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.
Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She
was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the
Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -
- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.
When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling
it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.
When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.
According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia
was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in
November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.
When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General
Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,
especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to
fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of
torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.
Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's
overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators had
failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: ""The state police have done a thoroughly
professional job. I have no doubt about that."" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators had
properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.
Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil
society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously
express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.
""We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,"" said one municipal
police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. ""There are too few of us
and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops
in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,
though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.
But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any
better here.""
The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.
The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a
breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of
paranoia.
Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia
was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police
handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone
powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.
Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have
no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are
being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked
to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.
And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer
masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of
Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug
trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is
suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,
Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.
In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring
five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to
deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and
the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.
Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather
than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian
background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out
the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according
to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview
last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to
discuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.
Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. ""We don't believe that the guys they have
arrested are the killers,"" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. ""It's obvious that they're just
scapegoats.""
Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. ""Today the killings continue because
there are many imitators,"" she told Salon last week. ""But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a
year."" But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from
October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.
Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one
popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits
a financial motive for murder. ""We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,"" says a young municipal
police officer who declined to give his name. ""Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of
money in the U.S."" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a
hunch.
Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But
where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an
incipient revolt.
On her radio show ""Grueso Calibre"" (""Large Caliber""), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests
who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of
the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,
advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and
was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the
receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.
Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,
she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.
Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of
Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequent
guest on ""Grueso Calibre."" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police
incompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.
In Nuestras Hijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a ""For Rent"" sign out front,
Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.
She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. ""Rascon came all the way to
Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,"" she tells Salon. ""Then I got a message on
my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them."" Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated
Press, denied the allegation.
Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt
was orchestrated by Rascon's office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting
with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the
murders.
Victims' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been
threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped
in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and
Aguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local
family.
To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the
kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed
no one. ""I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody,"" she said. ""On the contrary, we support the families and
they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.""
Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not
exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-
ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.
""But it's too late to stop now,"" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.
Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an
unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven
others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the
vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.
However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4
article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.
Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for ""establishing North American
industries, today the most important in the world."" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone
Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused
on Juarez's crisis of violence.
Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an
expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective's
goals and the problems confronting the group. ""Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are
principally concerned with the manipulation of life,"" he says. ""The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'
insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for
reparation and simply regaining our daily lives.""
Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an
impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to ""communicate through a different
language, one that's symbolic."" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.
The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, ""Antigone,""
which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has
organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.
The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall
spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. On
Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the
victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the
victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a
coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.
""It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of
reaction from the people,"" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. ""People are no longer affected by what is
happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.""
While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drastically
different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond
the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called
Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.
Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of
Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive
earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in
1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend their help during
natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-
awareness campaign.
Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says.
""I've narrowly escaped violence many times,"" she explains. ""Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to
come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our
indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them.""
Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success
where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia
lvette Gonzalez's overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.
And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.
Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing
members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have
accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches
are a family activity.
On one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,
including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people
stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders
are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the
quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.
""Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions,"" says Santos. ""We all have
sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.""

fyi, drug violence, cuidad juarez and women. Sid
FYI, a lot of the violence in Cuidad Juarez has historically been targeted against women. In 2002, Max wrote this report
from Juarez, the first report by an American from the scene, winning the Annenberg Online Journalism Award, the

Day of the dead
More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with
government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.
By Max Blumenthal
Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad
Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated
tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence
suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been dead
for seven months.
However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar
circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot
not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no
reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the
deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.
Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the
poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as
maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like
them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.
Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows
who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced
allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers
must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are
the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the
highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are
only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.
One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.
Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population
in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of
people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law
enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015

they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old
West, but with a grim 21st century edge.
Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have
yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is
hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy
towards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in
Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.
But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family
members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out
even if it means threats and other reprisals.
Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities
have done little to investigate. ""Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,"" the
mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. ""They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week
later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got
witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.""
Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and
murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of
its efforts at economic expansion.
To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10
people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference
and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal
government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County
were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number
of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.
That's Juarez today.
The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern
shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national
average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or
so maquiladoras for their livelihoods.
To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a
luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,
many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes
can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the
maquiladoras' featureless walls.
Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent
colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,
electricity or paved roads.
Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio
Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a
vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back
and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,
however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where
many of the slain and missing women were last seen.
In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside
the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.
""A lot of girls were picked up here,"" Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. ""But really, it's the girls' fault. It's because
even though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to get
into those cars if they didn't want to.""
Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered
by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.
""Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends
violently,"" she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. ""It's difficult to
know.""
A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large
majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.
Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and
with little means of contacting their families back home.
The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.
An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much
as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are
caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768643 Date: 08/31/2015
high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little
pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.
Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own
maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment
subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor
manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant
down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their
peak in October 2000.
Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health
system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their
company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-
women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July
alone.
The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually
invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain
women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.
Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed
upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,
the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of
drinking.
Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The
effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have
posted banners on their factories reading: ""STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite."" But most foreign
companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have
maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.
Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven
others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the
street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a
Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.
Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --
recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darkness
of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late
after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their
shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her
worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.
Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public
statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another
wave of violence. ""Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,"" she said. ""[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen
on Lear property.""
When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her
with responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious
situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home
from Lear's plant on her last day.
""We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,"" Puchalsky said. ""When she had arrived late to work her
shift, she was not there in time to work her shift.""
When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their
shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear's
operations. ""There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,"" she said. ""Typically what we do
is if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrive
late, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.""
The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,
and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad
Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.
Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She
was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the
Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -
- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.
When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling
it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.
When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.

According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia
was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in
November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.
When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General
Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,
especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to
fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of
torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.
Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's
overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators had
failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: ""The state police have done a thoroughly
professional job. I have no doubt about that."" But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators had
properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.
Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil
society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously
express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.
""We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,"" said one municipal
police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. ""There are too few of us
and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops
in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,
though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.
But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any
better here.""
The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.
The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a
breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of
paranoia.
Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia
was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police
handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone
powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.
Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have
no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are
being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked
to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.
And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer
masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of
Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug
trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is
suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,
Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.
In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring
five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to
deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and
the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.
Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather
than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian
background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out
the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according
to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview
last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to
discuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.
Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. ""We don't believe that the guys they have
arrested are the killers,"" says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. ""It's obvious that they're just
scapegoats.""
Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. ""Today the killings continue because
there are many imitators,"" she told Salon last week. ""But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a
year."" But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from
October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.
Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one
popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits
a financial motive for murder. ""We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,"" says a young municipal

police officer who declined to give his name. ""Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of
money in the U.S."" When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a
hunch.
Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But
where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an
incipient revolt.
On her radio show ""Grueso Calibre"" (""Large Caliber""), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests
who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of
the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,
advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and
was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the
receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.
Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,
she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.
Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of
Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequent
guest on ""Grueso Calibre."" Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police
incompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.
In Nuestras Hijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a ""For Rent"" sign out front,
Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.
She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. ""Rascon came all the way to
Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,"" she tells Salon. ""Then I got a message on
my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them."" Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated
Press, denied the allegation.
Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt
was orchestrated by Rascon's office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting
with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the
murders.
Victims' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been
threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped
in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and
Aguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local
family.
To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the
kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed
no one. ""I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody,"" she said. ""On the contrary, we support the families and
they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.""
Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not
exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-
ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.
""But it's too late to stop now,"" Lopez adds with a wistful smile.
Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an
unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven
others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the
vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.
However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4
article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.
Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for ""establishing North American
industries, today the most important in the world."" Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone
Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused
on Juarez's crisis of violence.
Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an
expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective's
goals and the problems confronting the group. ""Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are
principally concerned with the manipulation of life,"" he says. ""The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'
insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for
reparation and simply regaining our daily lives.""
Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an
impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to ""communicate through a different
language, one that's symbolic."" This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.

The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, ""Antigone,""
which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has
organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.
The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall
spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. On
Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the
victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the
victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a
coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.
""It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of
reaction from the people,"" says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. ""People are no longer affected by what is
happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.""
While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drastically
different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond
the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called
Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.
Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of
Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive
earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in
1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend their help during
natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-
awareness campaign.
Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says.
""I've narrowly escaped violence many times,"" she explains. ""Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to
come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our
indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them.""
Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success
where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia
lvette Gonzalez's overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.
And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.
Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing
members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have
accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches
are a family activity.
On one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,
including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people
stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders
are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the
quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.
""Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions,"" says Santos. ""We all have
sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.""

Madam Secretary -
One of our Mexican staff and the husbands of two Mexican employees were killed last night in Juarez.
In one case a Mexican employee and her husband were leaving a party hosted by another Mexican employee. They were
in separate vehicles. He was stopped by a hit squad and killed before her.
In a second case a Mexican employee and her husband were killed leaving the same party. Their 3 month-old baby was
left alive in the back seat.
We have activated all investigative and intelligence channels to learn all we can. The head of Mexico's intelligence
service called to express President Calderon's condolences and to offer any support we need. Patricia Espinosa is aware.
She may call you. We will let you know if there are any leads on why this tragedy occurred.

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
""We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time,"" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.

""UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
""Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.""
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.
However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination ""to kidnap children and get them out of the country"".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was ""an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months"".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
""We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,"" he said.
""This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.""
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

Eric, Elizabeth,
Attached is what I drafted for the Secretary. It is pretty straightforward; lifted more or less from their website. To the
extent that you have editorial commentary, please send it our way. I'll be traveling with S on Monday for the Montreal
conference and we expect the trust fund concept to be a big topic of conversation. S is very interested in using Aceh
Fund as a model.

The approach we took was to integrate our emphasis on women throughout the strategy, vice indicating that it was a

health and judicial access where women's issues are highlighted in the strategy. We are completely open to how best to
address this.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

""distinguished Diplomat"" award at VMI. I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department
head of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a
""done deal.""
All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the award.
They want to give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to
address the corps of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

Subject: Bloomberg-South America Leaders Propose Haiti Aid, Avoid Strife (Update3)
By Alexander Cuadros
Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- South American leaders agreed to provide $300 million in aid to Haiti at a summit in Ecuador after
skirting regional disputes that have undermined relations on the continent since 2008.
The 12 members of the Union of South American Nations, or Unasur, endorsed an accord today calling for a $100 million
fund as well as a $200 million ""preferential"" credit from the Inter-American Development Bank. The money would be
channeled to programs benefiting Haiti's reconstruction in areas such as agriculture, electricity infrastructure, health
and education.
""Latin America has stood up,"" Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said, addressing the summit at his presidential palace.
""The time has come to create a new kind of south-south aid.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769799 Date: 08/31/2015
The meeting marks Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's first visit to Ecuador since his armed forces staged a cross-border
raid on a guerrilla camp there almost two years ago. The attack killed rebel leader Raul Reyes, prompted Correa to break
off ties with his northern neighbor and led Venezuela's Hugo Chavez to order tanks to his country's border with
Colombia.
Leaders including Organization of American States Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said today aid efforts should
follow instructions from the government of Haitian President Rene Preval, who attended the meeting. Correa said
member nations should scrap tariffs on Haitian imports and consider subsidizing natural gas exports to the Caribbean
nation.
IDB Support
Carlos Melo, the IDB's representative in Ecuador, said he spoke to bank chief Luis Alberto Moreno, who supported a 15-
to 20-year $200 million credit to be taken on by Unasur. Correa said member countries should consider contributing 25
cents per inhabitant to the $100 million fund.
Chavez canceled his attendance because of an electricity crisis he's facing at home, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo
Patino told reporters today. At a gathering in Argentina last August, Chavez assailed a deal allowing the U.S. access to
seven Colombian military bases, saying it was part of a strategy to dominate the region.
About 100 protesters gathered today outside the presidential palace, carrying signs reading ""Uribe equals the threat of
war"" and chanting criticisms of Correa for receiving his Colombian counterpart.
Regional Integration
Unasur was formed two years ago in a bid to promote regional integration. In 2008, at a summit in Santiago, the group
provided political backing to Bolivian President Evo Morales after clashes between his supporters and government
opponents over a new constitution left 30 people dead.
The leaders of the continent's two biggest economies skipped today's talks. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner has canceled foreign travel amid a political dispute over control of the central bank's reserves.
Brazilian President Luiz lnacio Lula da Silva isn't attending because of conflicts in his agenda, according to his press
office. He sent his top foreign policy adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, to represent him.
No bilateral meeting is planned between Correa and Uribe, Ecuador's state news agency cited Patino as saying Feb. 4.
Unasur countries rushed doctors, food and emergency supplies to Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, in the
aftermath of the Jan. 12 earthquake. At least 200,000 people died in the quake, Haiti's government said Feb. 6.
Brazil Aid
Lula signed a, decree Jan. 26 providing 375 million reais ($200 million) in aid to Haiti. Brazil, which leads a United Nations
peacekeeping contingent in Haiti, had already pledged about $17 million to the country, the most among Latin American
nations, according to UN data.
Venezuela forgave Haiti's oil-related debt and donated 225,000 barrels of fuel, while Colombia sent more than 200
search-and-rescue personnel and committed hundreds of tons of humanitarian supplies. Ecuador has sent rescue teams
and donated several tons of food, UN data show. Peruvian President Alan Garcia, speaking at the summit today, said
Peru was willing to contribute $10 million.

Colombia and Ecuador began taking steps late last year to restore full relations. The neighbors named diplomatic envoys
and re-established military ties in November. Ecuador this month also eliminated the last of the tariffs it imposed on
Colombian goods in 2009.

I join President Obama in congratulating President-elect Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III, whom the Filipino
people have chosen to lead their nation. The Philippines' successful election exemplified the vitality of the
country's democratic institutions and should be a point of pride for Filipinos everywhere. The Filipino people
now look to President-elect Aquino to carry forward the democratic traditions that his parents did so much to
champion. The United States has long stood with the Philippines as a trusted ally and friend and we will
continue to support the ongoing efforts of the Filipino people to build a secure and prosperous country.

Subject: (Reuters) Russia says Iran sanctions do not bar missile deal
MOSCOW —The Foreign Ministry said the new UN sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear program do not oblige
Moscow to scrap a controversial deal to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko
spoke after the Interfax news agency cited a Russian arms industry source as saying Russia would freeze its unfulfilled
contract to sell S-300 missiles to Iran because of the sanctions.

On eve of Mother's Day, Clinton pushes for paid leave for new parents From CNN Senior State Department Producer
Elise Labott WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to push Congress to get paid leave for
federal employees who are parents of newborn or newly adopted children on Friday, in a videotaped Mother's. Day
message to State Department employees.""I know how challenging it can be to balance the demands of work and
family,"" Clinton said. ""Whether you're welcoming a new baby, juggling soccer practice and piano lessons, or even
helping plan your daughter's wedding --parenting can be more than a full-time job.""Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, is
getting married this summer. Currently, federal employees do not get paid maternity or paternity leave. Clinton said she
would work with Congress to take ""overdue"" steps to provide State Department families with the paid time off they
need to recuperate from childbirth, care for the mother, care for a newborn With a serious ailment or disability, or
complete an adoption.""We can and should do more to provide public servants with the same maternity and paternity
leave benefits that many private sector employers already offer,"" Clinton said. ""They're standard for many other
governments around the world. It's not enough to just talk about the importance of family-- our policies must reflect our
commitment and our values.""Clinton has been at the forefront of the Obama administration in pushing for better
benefits for federal employees. She was the administration's first cabinet secretary to ask for benefits for same-sex
partners of federal employees, requesting the extension for Foreign Service employees. President Obama has since
extended some benefits to same-sex partners of employees throughout the federal government.

From: Sid
Re: The day after Gordon
Whatever the outcome, whichever party ultimately makes a pact with the Lib-Dems, or whether
neither does, the next British government will be remarkably weak, flimsy and fly apart within
months. That is the only certainty now.
On Gordon's political suicide, David, Labour: Neither David Miliband nor Shaun (who has been
constantly on the phone with Gordon and by his side since the election as a sort of therapist)
were privy to the decision; nor did Gordon tell either before making his announcement on the
steps of No. 10. Gordon's confidant in contemplating his end was only Peter, the penultimate
scene (there must be at least one more) of their twisted relationship rooted in the Tony-Gordon-
Peter triangle now transmuted into the perverse Gordon-Peter-David triangle. David is the heir,
the son, ""Our Boy,"" as Anji Hunter describes him to me, playing a version of the Tony role.
Shaun and David met alone for an hour and a half late last night to discuss the whole situation.
David is well aware of Peter's perversity, that Peter has been plotting to usurp his position as
foreign secretary, that Peter seeks to direct his campaign as leader, that Peter wishes to be the
arbiter and controlling figure in a government under David. At this point, David does not want
Peter to run his campaign but involved. Does Peter know this? No. David is wary of a deal with
the Lib-Dems and understands his perilous position in the event he were to become leader as the
second unelected PM in a row. Upon reflection, it may be that a Labour-Lib-Dem alliance would
not be the harbinger of a grand progressive coalition, but an illusion under these circumstances.
If an arrangement were to be made the government would be extraordinarily unstable. Because it
would be subject to the demands of every bit player, the government would have the potential of
collapsing over every issue large or small. It could not last long. Under the stress, the result
might be that in an inevitable election to be held six to eighteen months (at the outside) from
now, the Conservatives would be posed to gain the majority just beyond their grasp. Shaun
advised David to work things out with his brother Ed, trying to persuade him not to compete
against him. If Ed runs for leader against David, Ed Balls, Gordon's heir in the same sense that
David is Tony's, might get through, which would put Labour back at square one, bearing the
burden of Gordon again.

Meanwhile, Peter negotiates with the LD team, a meeting that has broken up by this afternoon.
Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party, which two days ago was eager to lead the way to a
coalition with Labour, the LDs, and other parties, has announced it has dropped out of any
arrangment, which also means the Welsh national party, its partner, has dropped out. Meanwhile,
David Blunkett, former Labour home secretary, has denounced any deal with the LDs.
Meanwhile, some prominent LDs have denounced a Labour-LD coalition as a ""coalition of the
defeated"" and a deal with the Tories as ""the only game in town."" Meanwhile, Clegg met
privately with Cameron this morning while Peter, et al were meeting with the LD negotiators.
Meanwhile, this afternoon, Cameron has upped his offer to the LDs on a referendum, insisting
today is ""decision time."" Meanwhile, the Tory right denounces any deal with the LDs.
Meanwhile, Clegg dithers.
It has been said of the Lib-Dem Party that anytime anyone tries to use it, it simply crumbles in
their hands. So far, so good. I suspect for the party that allies with the LDs, the deal will be a
poisoned chalice.
More to come soon...

UNAMA chief Staffan De Mistura and his deputy Martin Kobler said they brokered an agreement today between Afghan
NSA Spanta, Civil society reps and Sima Simar for the Kabul Conference. There will be one chair at the table and one
chair behind. The civil society rep will sit at the table ( the woman who was mentioned earlier (P...?); sorry I don't recall
right now; Kathy recognized her name). Sima Simar would sit behind. Eight minutes would be allow for speaking and
the civil society rep will begin. Please, however, Staffan and Martin asked that we please keep this compromise quiet so
it will hold. Staffan thanked us for our pushing the Afghan government in this direction by our quiet interventions over
the past few days.

KINGSTON, Jamaica - (AP) Police say businesses in Jamaica's capital have been closing early as rumors spread that the
government has signed extradition papers for Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke, a man described by the U.S. as a major drug
kingpin. Police commissioner Owen Ellington says officers are monitoring the situation and there is no threat to public
safety. Local media say the government has denied signing extradition papers.

The interagency briefing for Hill staff (leadership, foreign affairs, appropriations, arms services) today was
uneventful. Mostly predictable questions (where is China; effect on Iran resolution; defense posture...) and no criticism
of the way the Administration has handled this so far. Interestingly, no question or push on SSTL. If this exchange is a
good indication of Hill temperature, I think we are doing ok at the moment.

RIYADH (AP) - A senior Saudi official says the kingdom's aged ruler will fly to the United States for ""medical tests."" The
official says King Abdullah will leave the kingdom on November 22, three days after he was admitted to the hospital
suffering from back pain due to a blood clot. The 86-year-old Crown Prince Sultan, who himself spent over a year in the
U.S. and Morocco for medical treatment and recuperation, will arrive at Riyadh on November 21 to oversee the
kingdom, the official said. The official spoke late November 20 on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the press. The palace said November 19 that King Abdullah was hospitalized after a blood clot
had created pressure on the nerves surrounding a ruptured disc.

Subject: From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador
Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law ""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are now calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia
and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to
convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.
He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and
rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We
have prepared a call sheet for you.

It's fair for smaller countries to turn to international conventions
MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew supports the use of international conventions to solve border disputes, especially when
the countries involved are not of equal standing.
By way of illustration, he said it was ""fair"" for smaller countries like Vietnam to resolve disputes with China using
conventions like Unclos —the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
He made the point at a dialogue of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum yesterday, when he was asked by former
Japanese senator Kotaro Tamura to comment on the ongoing China-Japan dispute.
Mr Tamura, in his question, made his feelings clear, describing China as a ""teenager"" in its handling of the situation.
Adding that China was also pushing around other countries like those in South-east Asia, he asked if it was a good idea
for countries with potential border problems to team up and take China into a multilateral negotiation.
Mr Lee, in his response, noted that multiparty negotiations had been proposed by United States Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in a visit to Vietnam this July.
But Mrs Clinton's statement had upset China, he added.
Mr Lee said: ""It was a really quiet statement but I think it also drew a line, a red line which will not make the Chinese
very happy.
""As you can see its foreign minister says it's none of America's business, it is a bilateral matter with the Philippines, with
Brunei, with Vietnam.""
The three South-east Asian countries, China and some others have all laid claim — either in whole or in part — to the
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
But any bilateral negotiation with China is unlikely to be a fair fight, he said.
""So if you deal with China, and Vietnam with 100 million (people) and they've got 1,300 million, where is your punching
power?"" he asked.
He cited a 2008 dispute over a deal Vietnam made with US oil giant ExxonMobil to do oil exploration in contested
waters.
""The Chinese told ExxonMobil: 'Move on or you'll get no business from China.' So ExxonMobil moved on,"" he said. That
is why, he said, a multilateral, Unclos- based solution was just.
He stressed that negotiations needed to be based on internationally accepted rules.
Mrs Clinton, he said, probably did not act independently when making the statement in Hanoi and would have consulted
her country's national security lobby and even the president.

He said the US policy made it clear that territorial claims were more complex than producing a map with dotted lines
and saying: ""All this is mine"".
""I mean who produces this map? What is the authenticity of this map? Who kept it? And even if you can prove its
antiquity, what does it show?
""It shows that at that time these countries were not independent and (were) under French, American or British or other
rule and so they could not object.
""But now they're independent and they're entitled to protest. It's within their EEZ (exclusive economic zone); it's within
their territorial waters,""
he said.
Mr Lee said the points made by the US in Hanoi draw an ""important line against bilateral dealings which are unequal"".
He also spoke on Japan's current spat with China, the worst between the two countries in years, which was sparked
earlier this month when Japan detained a Chinese ship captain following a sea collision near the disputed Senkaku
islands.
Japan, however, released the captain on Saturday.
Mr Lee felt that moving to settle the dispute was probably the right thing to do.
He said: ""Supposing he (Japanese PM Naoto Kan) decided to do otherwise, then what? Then the Senkaku islands will
become a dispute. Then they will send their navy there. Then you will send your navy there.
""And normally (you) have better ships than they have. But they will build an aircraft carrier. So in 10 years they have a
bigger fleet than you have, so you have to factor that into your calculation.
""These are the realities of power.""

Re: GOP unpopularity, Boehner unpopularity, stealth agenda for campaign and beyond
The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second Ohio poll below.)
The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats, succeeding beyond
their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush matchup and question 12 in second poll
on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in 2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative campaign against Obama.
The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in making it only about
approval of Obama.
The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's best known. To
the extent he is known, he is disliked.
The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old Republicans, to the
extent they make any sort of offer.
The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and now religious
rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend of mine,
So tar, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no contest. Republicans
are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists. They are not being pressed for their
refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party being revealed as an extremist takeover movement.
Nor is the Republicans' motive for smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put
Boehner in power.
Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans—from illegal immigration to the ""ground zero mosque""—is not
about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John Boehner, that old scandal ridden

hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner
power-grab.
The Republican Party is the same old party. It's unreformed. It hasn't learned anything. It can't control its
extremists.

Previewing Ohio
We'll start rolling out our Ohio poll results tomorrow but there's one finding on the poll that pretty much sums it
up: by a 50-42 margin voters there say they'd rather have George W. Bush in the White House right now than
Barack Obama.
Independents hold that view by a 44-37 margin and there are more Democrats who would take Bush back
(11%) than there are Republicans who think Obama's preferable (3%.)
A couple months ago I thought the Pennsylvanias and Missouris and Ohios of the world were the biggest
battlegrounds for 2010 but when you see numbers like this it makes you think it's probably actually the
Californias and the Wisconsins and the Washingtons.
There's not much doubt things are getting worse for Democrats.. .and they were already pretty bad. Somehow
the party base needs to get reinvigorated over the next two months or there's going to be a very, very steep price
to pay.

GOP Leads OH Generic Ballot, Boehner Not Popular
Raleigh, N.C. — Despite expanding their lead to 47-41 over Democrats in the generic
Congressional ballot, only 29% of likely Ohio voters approve of the direction of the
Republican Party, with 55% disapproving, suggesting that their preference for the GOP is
simply a vote for change, not a vote of affirmation or a mandate. Also supporting that
notion: a 43% plurality finds the GOP to be too conservative, with only 29% seeing their
views as ""about right.""
And in bad news for Minority Leader John Boehner, only 28% of his home-state voters
want him to become Speaker if Republicans take back the U.S. House, with 44%
preferring ""someone else."" GOP voters do support Boehner for Speaker, but only by a
54-15 margin. Democrats, who would not vote for a Republican majority anyway,

oppose him, 73-6, and independents, 41-22.
In June, Republicans were favored for Congress only 44-43 among registered voters, but
the six-point shift in the partisan makeup of the likely electorate corresponds almost
exactly with the shift in the generic ballot. On top of that, Republicans are united around
their party's candidates 94-1, versus Democrats at 89-6. Democrats have actually
improved slightly among independents, though Republicans still lead 36-23. There is
considerable room for Democratic House candidates to make up ground by appealing to
the 41% of unaffiliateds who are undecided and by boosting turnout among their voters.
While Republicans approve of the direction of their party, 59-20, independents
disapprove, 61-13. 31% of Republicans and 20% of independents find the GOP too
liberal, but 76% of Democrats and 43% of independents find it too conservative.
There has been no change in the race for Attorney General. Mike DeWine leads
Democrat Richard Cordray 44-40 after leading 44-41 in June.
PPP surveyed 475 likely Ohio voters from August 27th to 29th. The margin of error for
the survey is +/-4.5%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting,
may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

Email from 9/6/10, on interview
Off the record: I had long conversation yesterday with very scary. His
prediction: ""a wave of Biblical proportions"" in Novem3er. the House is gone; he sees a new bloc of up to 10
true conservative senators, joining Coburn and DeMint, and creating a virtual third party in Senate holding
balance of power. He says their polling suggests Tea Party candidates well ahead in Ky. Colo. senate races
(NYT disputes that today) , and Nevada still a tossup. .1 went to the Glenn Back rally, an
largely agreed with my assessment that its purpose in part was to inoculate the movement against public
concern over extremism and racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope, Charity.) Americans for
Prosperity (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc.
No love lost for post-1996 Republican hacks, among whom he numbered Gingrich, DeLay, Hastert -- and Rove
who is on the outs with his people.
Oversight committees will take lead in House after GOP victory, with a particular focus on Holder and Justice
Dept. and KSM decision. Purpose will be to keep Democrats on defensive for whole 2 years leading up to 2012
election. (Obama, you recall, nixed investigations of Bush administration because he wanted to unite the
country.) Would there be an investigation of Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally
focused on the election, not what comes after.
My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no chance of senate
passage) ; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and there will be stand-alone vote to
block EPA from implementing carbon rules (even though EPA is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court
decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..

(Haaretz) Netanyahu urges top ministers to extend settlement freeze
PM to convene inner cabinet on Tuesday for vote on a 60-day moratorium in exchange for U.S. guarantees.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his forum of top ministers on Tuesday afternoon to debate extending
Israel's moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements for 60 days.
The concession would be made in exchange for a series of reported U.S. guarantees in Israel's direct peace negotiations
with the Palestinians. Israel halted construction temporarily for 10 months, a freeze that ended on September 26.
The Palestinians have said they would not continue the recently renewed negotiations unless Israel agreed to halt
construction again. The Obama administration has urged Israel to reconsider its refusal of that demand.
If Netanyahu succeeds in convincing the Forum of Seven to accept an extension of the construction freeze, he plans to
bring the matter to the political-security cabinet for a vote later Tuesday.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak (Labor) and Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor (Likud) are expected to
support Netanyahu's position, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) is likely to present the
greatest opposition.
Netanyahu is pinning his hopes now on Ministers Benny Begin (Likud), Moshe Ya'alon (Likud) and Eli Yishai (Shas). The
prime minister has already met with Begin over the last few days in an attempt to convince him to change his previously
expressed opposition to extending the freeze.

Obama hopes START treaty will pass Congress soon
(AFP) – 7 hours ago
WASHINGTON — US President Barack Obama Thursday said he hoped that a landmark nuclear weapons deal
with Russia would win Congress approval before the end of this year.
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was negotiated earlier this year to replace a similar treaty
which expired at the end of December.
Obama appealed to Republicans to help approve the treaty when Congress returns on November 15, after the
party put up stiff opposition to the new deal fearing it could hamper US missile defense plans.
""This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue, but, rather, an issue of American national security,""
Obama said at a cabinet meeting, two days after Republicans posted strong gains in congressional elections.
""I'm hopeful that we can get that done.., and send a strong signal to Russia that we're serious about reducing
nuclear arsenals, but also send a signal to the world that we're serious about non-proliferation,"" Obama said.
The new Congress takes office in January, with Republicans set to take control of the House of Representatives
and to add members to the Senate. So the next two months are known as a ""lame duck"" session, in which
outgoing lawmakers often shy away from major legislation.
But START was facing trouble even in the current Congress. Under the US constitution, treaties need the
approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The START treaty -- signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Obama at an elaborate ceremony in
Prague in April -- restricts each nation to a maximum of 1,550 deployed warheads, a cut of about 30 percent
from a limit set in 2002.
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed Obama's appeal, urging the Senate to ratify a treaty to ensure the
resumption of inspections of Russia's arsenal.
His press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told reporters that Gates ""and many other former defense secretaries and
national security officials, from both parties, have frequently voiced their strong belief that this treaty is

absolutely critical to the effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal, our knowledge of Russian nuclear capabilities, and
US national security overall.""
In the Senate, the treaty enjoys the support of Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, along with several former Republican secretaries of state including Henry Kissinger.
But a growing number of Republicans have voiced opposition, saying it would impede the US ability to set up
missile defenses against future potential threats such as Iran.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination to run
against Obama in 2012, has led the charge criticizing START.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Vice President Biden arrived in Iraq on August 30 as U.S. troops prepared to end combat
operations on August 31.
Biden was expected to hold talks with Iraqi leaders during a period of political deadlock, almost six months after an
inconclusive election in March, over forming the country's next government.
His visit comes at a time when Iraq is on high alert for attacks by insurgents after a series of bombings that killed
dozens of people and underscored the fragility of Iraq's recent security gains.

Subject: (AP) American visits Iran blast site under freedom deal
TEHRAN (AP) — An Iranian-American businessman freed after more than two years in Tehran's main prison visited
survivors of a deadly 2008 mosque bombing as a condition of his release in a scripted event that could carry propaganda
value at home. Iranian authorities did not immediately explain their demand for 71-year-old Reza Taghavi to pay homage
in the southern city of Shiraz and personally acknowledge an attack in which he denies having any connection. But it
would fit neatly into possible Iranian attempts to squeeze multiple messages from Taghavi's October 16 release after 29
months in custody. Taghavi, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, fulfilled his pledge to visit the site of the mosque
bombing. They later met with survivors, including people who lost relatives in the attack.
The U.S. and allies fear Iran could use its nuclear fuel labs to eventually produce weapons-grade material. Iran says it
only seeks peaceful energy-producing reactors. Taghavi's attorney, former U.S. diplomat Pierre Prosper, said he
purposely left American officials out of the negotiations to avoid having his client become a bargaining chip. ""Our strategy
was to make sure that our dialogue with the [Iranian] government was between us and them,"" said Prosper, who held five
rounds of direct talks with Iranian envoys since Taghavi was jailed.

Interaction op-ed that Raj Shah was told will appear in the Washington Post also appeared in Sunday Daily Times in
Pakistan.
by Samuel A. Worthington
The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to difficult areas
and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of killing, kidnapping and
intimidation.
Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us to do —
only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.
I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations conducting relief
work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent floods in Pakistan, and many
of them have been in Pakistan for decades.
Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food, water,
essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent weeks, the Obama
administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too ""afraid to have association with the U.S.
government"" while distributing aid in Pakistan.
None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are cowards.
The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people whose lives have been
devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.
Of course, I understand where the administration is coming from. The U.S.-funded assistance we provide saves lives and
helps struggling communities rebuild. In the battle for hearts and minds in Pakistan, U.S. officials argue, the failure to
clearly advertise that the American government is behind this help — with, for instance, logos on medicines or signs on
food-distribution centers — is a missed opportunity. In 2009 the United States approved $7.5 billion in assistance to
Pakistan over the next five years; however, as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius noted recently, Pakistanis read
more about American drone attacks than about these aid dollars.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772632 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772632 Date: 08/31/2015
In countries such as Liberia or Democratic Republic of Congo, U.S. NGOs that get funding from the U.S. government
routinely promote the fact that they are delivering help ""from the American people."" But in Pakistan, where aid workers'
lives are more often at stake, an enforced branding campaign could undermine our ability to deliver assistance as fast as
possible without being a lightning rod for protests or attacks. It would also put the lives of Americans and their Pakistani
colleagues at risk. (It is usually Pakistani nationals who do the bulk of the work on the ground.)
In an environment where we are often soft targets for militants, drawing attention to our connection to the U.S.
government makes us even more vulnerable.
In March, one of InterAction's most active members in Pakistan, World Vision — which works on issues from health care
to farming to literacy — was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly called the North-West Frontier Province), and
seven of its employees were killed. And a year ago, the office of the World Food Program in Islamabad was attacked,
and five employees were killed.
There must be a balance among mitigating the risks NGOs face, communicating U.S. goodwill and delivering assistance
effectively. NGOs must be allowed to strike that balance on their own every day — even if the upshot is that we don't
include U.S. signs on new health clinics.
In some cases, particularly in less-volatile regions of Pakistan, conspicuously identifying aid as American may not pose a
threat to our work. But in areas where militants are particularly active, the risks to those delivering the aid may be great.
These judgments must be made by the NGOs on the ground, depending on local circumstances, and not directed by the
State Department's branding concerns.
In Pakistani tribal areas along the Afghan border, for instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development has
granted our members waivers allowing us not to brand U.S. assistance, but there is growing pressure by the government
for these waivers to be phased out. While I agree that U.S. aid to the Pakistani people and government needs to be more
visible, this could put humanitarian workers' lives in jeopardy.
The American people are enormously generous, as shown after Haiti's devastating earthquake in January and in the
aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami in Asia. In Pakistan, the United States — through military and civilian
assistance, as well as through NGOs — is playing a major role in response to the recent floods, which forced at least 15
million people from their homes. The humanitarian groups I represent are providing basics, including clean water,
medicine and shelter.
The debate over branding our efforts is not simply another technical policy decision; for us, it can be a matter of life and
death. NGOs and the Obama administration must work together to find a solution that allows humanitarian workers in
the field flexibility to brand or not, according to security conditions on the ground.

Unable to sustain solid growth, Pakistan's economy is
teetering on the brink of collapse, with one-third of the
population living below the poverty line. S. Akbar Zaidi
writes in a new brief that Pakistan's economic
instability stems in large part from low government
revenue due to the elite's use of tax evasions,
loopholes, and exemptions. Without tax reform,
Pakistan will continue to run an unsustainable debt
and be forced to rely on Western donors for bailouts.

2004 to 2005 he was a visiting
professor at Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced
International Studies (SAIS) and

Fascell Democracy Fellow at the

Democracy.
Zaidi's twelfth book, Military,
Civil Society and
Democratization in Pakistan, is
to be published by Vanguard
Press, Lahore in October 2010.
Policy Recommendations:
• Eliminate exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million
citizens pay any income tax, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is just 9
percent. By eliminating tax exemptions for the rich, politicians can fund
essential social services.
• Increase tax revenue. Pakistani legislators must build a consensus to tax the
rich and elite if they want to match growth rates in nearby developing
countries.
• Spend more on development. Pakistan has spent twice as much on defense
during peacetime as it has on education and health combined—this needs to
change.
• Stop the bailouts. Donor countries must put conditions on funding and
should emphasize tax and economic reform to help Pakistan develop long-
term economic plans for sustainable growth.
""Pakistan's lack of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax
evasion, burdening the country with unsustainable debt and undermining its
development priorities,"" writes Zaidi. ""The key to the country's economic prosperity—
even its survival—is a far-reaching program of tax reform.""

I have also attached a very good article (translated) from a Korean publication which describes what is called the
""Information Belt"" formed along the North Korea-China border.
Anybody with an appetite for more content, let me know and I'll send on high side.

For immediate release 14th November 2010:
Gerry Adams to seek Louth nomination for General Election
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams has today announced his decision to put his name forward for the Sinn
Fein nomination for the Louth constituency at the next General Election. Mr. Adams was speaking today
at the Edentubber commemoration in County Louth. He said:
""Ireland is at a crossroads. This state is in the midst of a deep economic and social crisis. This
Government is probably the most unpopular in the history of the state. It is now implementing bad,
deeply damaging policies. It has no mandate whatsoever for this.
There is a better way. Together we can rebuild Ireland.

People need to make a stand against what is happening. We need a better way forward for our country
and its people.
All this imposes a huge responsibility on those of us in positions of political leadership. In the past I
have asked people to step forward and to show leadership.
I have asked people to make a stand. I believe that it is my duty at this critical time to step forward and
do what I have asked of others.
As Leader of Sinn Fein, I want to be part of the necessary fight-back against bad economic policies in
both parts of this island and for a fair, decent and united society for all the people of Ireland.
As a representative of west Belfast I should be able to do this in the Dail, but the Irish government
refuses to allow this, despite a commitment during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and
subsequently, by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahem that he would introduce measures to allow speaking
rights for MPs from the north.
So, as Leader of the only all Ireland party with an all-island mandate I have a choice to make whether to
stay in west Belfast, a place that I love, or to seek a mandate in another constituency in the south. West
Belfast is my home. It is where Colette and our family are and where I live.
But after thoughtful consideration, and with the support of colleagues, I have decided to put my name
forward for Louth. If elected for this constituency I will work and stay here and travel home when
possible.
This means that I will be stepping down as an MLA for west Belfast. My replacement will be chosen
this week. I am proud and honoured to have represented the people of west Belfast in the Assembly. I
will remain as MP until the next Leinster House election.
This is a significant initiative by the Sinn'Fein leadership. It is a measure of our determination to provide
a real alternative to the consensus for cuts being pushed by the other parties.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774005 Date: 08/31/2015
Ireland needs political change. We need change in the Dail. We need more voices that will stand up
against the consensus for cuts – more voices that will stand up for ordinary people. We need new
politics. We need a political realignment.
A change of government without a change in policies will be worthless.
A Fine Gael led government, propped up by the Labour Party is not a real alternative.
Fine Gael and Labour offer nothing that is substantially different from the current government. They are
part of the consensus for cuts.
Sinn Fein is the only effective opposition in the Dail. We forced this government to hold the Donegal
South West by-election. We have shifted the debate on the economy by rejecting the consensus for cuts,
and producing a costed, viable economic programme that can protect the vulnerable and low and middle
income earners, while stimulating the economy and creating jobs.
This is a small island. The problems faced by citizens throughout the country are the same.
We have a republic only in name.
Sinn Fein is a republican party. We believe that a republic must first and foremost be about the welfare
of the community. This includes access to a decent public health service and the protection of vulnerable
people such as the old, the sick and those with disabilities.
It also includes at this time of crisis those who are economically vulnerable — including low and middle
income earners - a group that is growing in number by the day because of the bad policies pursued by
this Government.
As the leader of Sinn Fein, in this time of crisis in our country, I am making a stand with this initiative
— a stand for a better, fairer, united Ireland. I believe that things can be turned around. That there is a
better way.
Look at the progress that has been made in the north. The peace process has shown what is possible. The
North has been transformed for the better. Sinn Fein has led that transformation. We have demonstrated
what is possible when people work together in the common good, in the national interest, and for the
benefit of all.
Our focus at this time is on tackling the mistakes of this government and providing a real alternative to
the Fianna Fail lite policies of Fine Gael and Labour.

Whether it is charting a way out of conflict or striving to rebuild the economy, Sinn Fein is about
improving the quality of people's lives.
This must be the guide for the reconstruction of Ireland in the years ahead.
I intend to lead from the front.
The people of Ireland face enormous challenges at this time. But we are no mean people and I am
confident that with clear headed leadership and sound economic policies we can rebuild the economy
and return prosperity.
I want to pay tribute to Arthur Morgan who, for the past 8 years has been a first class representative for
the people of Louth and an outstanding member of Sinn Fein's Dail team.
I first met Arthur in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh where he was incarcerated for his republican beliefs.
I want to pay tribute to Marian. Without her Arthur could not have played the role that he has done over
the years.
He will continue to play an important role in Sinn Fein. His experience and talent will be available to
this party in Louth and nationally in the time ahead.
